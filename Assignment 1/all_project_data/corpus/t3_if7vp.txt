I'm a college student who's staying on campus over the summer to do research. I'm getting paid pretty fairly, but there were problems authorizing my account direct deposit and now I have two unpaid paychecks which will not go through until Friday. Usually I have buddies around to rely on, but since it's the summer pretty much everyone I know is gone. I plan to pay it forward when I get money in the bank. 

I should also say that I'm not really in need, as I have enough milk, ramen, frozen fruits, and rice to last me a whole semester, I just really crave some veggies / real meat right now. 

If you want some verification please PM me and I'll work with you.
