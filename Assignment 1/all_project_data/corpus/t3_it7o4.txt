Father has cut me off completely, refuses to pay for my final semester in school have been searching for jobs in LA for the past 2 months with no luck. I've sold most of my video games, music equipment and just about everything of value for food, but have finally run out of things to sell. Am finally giving up and will be flying to Florida next week to stay with my mother find a job and save up so I can return to school.

I would be eternally grateful if anyone could help me out with a pizza :)
