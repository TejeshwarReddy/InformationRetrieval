Hey there! I'm new here, and quite pregnant. My name is Cori. I got myself a verification code, whatever that means. I'm active on RAOAmazon. I'm new here, though. I'm on PERMANENT BEDREST until I'm induced in December. I have preeclampsia, which means for no reason than my body hates my baby, I have extremely high blood pressure and I could have a seizure at any moment. (Both my mom and my grandma lost their first children to eclampsia, the onset of the seizures, so I'm GRATEFUL to have knowledge of my condition. The docs say my baby and I should be TOTALLY fine!)

Sorry for the sob story, I know that's not what this wonderful place is about, but I just thought I'd let you know background to WHY I want a pizza! I'm off of work, obvs, because I have to be in bed all day (no more than 5 minutes on my feet at a time!), and ALSO, **my husband can't cook for SHIT**, so I'd like to take some responsibility off of him for the next two nights or so by getting him a fat pizza gift card! We have all the normal joints in our neighborhood, so any gift card would be sweet!

It would help make sure myself and my unborn child are fed something that wasn't burnt and scraped off of the bottom of the wrong pan for the occasion!

Thanks in advance for your
