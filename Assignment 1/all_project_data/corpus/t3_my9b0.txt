I'm working on a mountain in Vail Valley, CO this season, not getting paid very well, and am forced to live on a very tight budget (less than $10 a day). This is a very expensive place to live. I just got my first paycheck and all of it went to the person I am renting from. I am willing to do just about anything (legal) that is requested. I'm very hungry and hoping that someone can help me out! I promise to return the favor when I am able to! Thank you in advance!
