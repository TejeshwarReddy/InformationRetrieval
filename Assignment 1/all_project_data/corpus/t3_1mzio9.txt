Hey Pizza People! First of all I just want to thank you guys for being so awesome and making this subreddit possible. Once I have money, I plan to be a random-pizza-giver :3

So backstory. Last year (I was 18), I was sexually assaulted by a stranger not too far from Harvard Square. It resulted in some severe PTSD: I couldn't sleep or eat. I was hardly able to function or focus enough to even engage in casual conversation. I couldn't stand to exist in my own mind any longer so I tried to fix it by drinking, which only made me feel sick and more depressed. I tried smoking weed (I'd smoked often before and it seemed to help then) but now the weed gave me flashbacks to the assault and made it so much worse. I was getting desperate. I don't know how the idea got into my head, but one morning I was getting dressed and I just made the decision. It was this voice of deliberate recklessness that announced, "Today I'm going to try heroin."

It was alarmingly easy to get my hands on it. It was cheap and it was everything I needed. I knew it was stupid, but I didn't care. I had nothing left to lose - and why stop when it works?

Well eventually I ended up in a psych hospital for the PTSD and heroin addiction. I got help, I got my shit together, and I'm going to college.

So yeah. That's my story. This is me [before and after](http://imgur.com/blBMtWH) getting my shit together.

Thanks for reading this, if you did :) otherwise,

**TL;DR: Bad guy, PTSD, heroin, recovery, can I have pizza now please?**
