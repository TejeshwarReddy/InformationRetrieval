So, I made a throwaway account for this, I hope that's not against RAOP reddiquette. A ton of my friends are on reddit, and none of them know about my financial issues, and I'd like to keep it that way.

I don't have it as bad as some, but I'm freaking starving and this check went totally to other bills. I spearfish to supplement store bought food, but there has been a red tide in San Diego for the past week or so with horrible visibility so I haven't caught anything. Lobster season opens soon though!

So long story short, if you are looking to send out a pizza, I would sure be thankful!
