My sister and her husband and son are visiting my family.  We've tried to provide a nice stay for them.  We bought what food we could and cooked good meals as much as we could.  They've insisted on taking us out a few times and spent more money than I'm comfortable with.  Now he's decided that we should have pizza tonight, and their kid and our two kids are all excited, and that's great.  I just would really like to be able to pay for one thing this entire trip that they're here.  I've been unemployed for almost six months.  My wife is a bartender, and she's at work now, and we're hoping she makes at least $100 to cover the checks that are out for rent and bills.  I don't have any extra money to spend on pizza, but I'm tired of feeling worthless while they take care of everything.  There are six of us, and I'd like to be able to pick up a couple of pies and at least feel human again.  It's funny how being on here and asking strangers for help somehow seems less demeaning than taking help from family.  I don't know.  Just figured I'd ask.  Thanks for listening.  Feels good to get it out at least.
