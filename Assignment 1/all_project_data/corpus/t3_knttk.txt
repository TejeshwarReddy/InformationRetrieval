About two months ago, myself and three friends from high school moved into a cabin in North Western Indiana, that was built by one of my friends father.  We resorted to the cabin because we all work at McDonalds and could not afford anything else.  The place needed a lot of work as no one has lived in it for fifteen years prior to us.  Raccoons had torn out most of the dry wall and even got inside the cabin.  Nonetheless we were really excited about the whole rustic feel that the cabin gave off, ...... until it started getting cold.  We have only had a few frost nights so far, but Winter is Coming.  Our Cabin is not exactly "factory sealed" and doesn't exactly have a "heater".  So as Northern Indiana's harsh winter approaches we are feverishly (literally and figuratively) trying to figure out how to heat our cabin.  If someone would like to buy us a pizza to lift our spirits we would be greatly appreciative and we will pay it forward.
