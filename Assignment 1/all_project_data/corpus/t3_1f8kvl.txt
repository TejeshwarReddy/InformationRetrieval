I'm a high school student, both of parents hours have been cut so we are currently lacking in funds. To top off the bad luck, they are both sick today and couldn't go grocery shopping and they didnt have money to give me. This sounds to much like a sad story but honestly i dont know what im gonna eat today :\ On a good note, i passed a really hard test today so anything can help. I wasn't even able to eat lunch because my test extended into my lunch time... My school kinda sucks haha. Honestly, i would probably try paying you back if i could lol. But, thanks for reading everyone, i'm trying to keep my mood up through tough times. :)

UPDATE: Thanks to greasytshirt for saving my family's night today with a free dinner!
