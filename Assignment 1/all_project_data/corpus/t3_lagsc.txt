This week has got to be the hardest week of October so far...and it's about a week before my birthday as well.  So far, it's started off extremely stressful: annotated bibliography due tomorrow (10/13/2011) for art history along with 500-600 words of a proposal + thesis + works of art; horrible critique in advanced drawing 2...the redo for two of our projects is due this Friday (10/14/2011); I have a psychology test on drugs that Friday as well...; I gotta put out three logos by Thursday of next week which I haven't done yet because of the above items.

I could go on about how crappy this week has started and can only say that I wish time would go faster to get to my birthday (October 21!!!).  Would someone be kind enough to send pizza for these long nights to come?
