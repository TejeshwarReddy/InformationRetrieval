So here's the story, my friend and I share a house with another fellow and said other fellow is the leaseholder. He was very gung ho about re-signing and even asked us if we would like to continue staying so we naturally said yes, and this was about two months ago when he asked. Fast forward to today, we get the re-sign papers and then he decides he doesn't want to re-sign, well that's all fine and dandy if he doesn't want to re-sign but the lease is up on the 31st of this month, kind of messed up to decide that with 12 days remaining. So now we're in a bind and a pizza would really brighten up our night. Thanks for reading guys, and may your narwhals bacon forevermore.
