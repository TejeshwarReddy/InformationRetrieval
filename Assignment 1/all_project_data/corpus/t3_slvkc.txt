I have been hard at work trying to catch I_rape_cats and would like some pie to feed myself and the two other rapist catchers. 

Just kidding, were not really looking for I_rape_cats! My kids and I are at home and would love some pie. Its about dinner time and when asked they said they wanted pizza. We just spent our "Entertainment" money on stuff for our foster dog that we took in from a local private dog shelter. He is a shy dog and was beaten severely so were trying to make him in to a vital part of our pack so he can someday be adopted by a family that needs a loving kind dog. 

Lets not get stuff twisted, we have food and will not starve. However, we would like to get some pizza. 

Thanks to everyone that offers anyone pizza on here. each and everyone of you make a difference in someones day.
