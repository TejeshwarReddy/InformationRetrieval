fridge is looking pretty fucking shabby, will prove. I was fucked by a previous employer out of $3,000, now broke as shit with little food until at least Monday when i have a phone interview for food stamps but i've been denied before because of my past drug related crimes and how California laws are. You can rape and murder someone in California, get out of prison, and get food stamps, but you're fucked if you sell someone weed once. I know that won't get me much pity but I could really care less about that, i just want pizza and i heard this was the place for that......
