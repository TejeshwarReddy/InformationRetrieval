hello! i just subscribed today, so maybe this is a shot in the dark, but... i'm a severely underemployed freelancer with way too much time between work/checks... super hungry at the moment, and would love some pizza. the only place around here is dominos, but that's fine cos they're pretty cheap. i submitted invoices this week for $650, so i would gladly repay double the pizza when i get my checks, which will hopefully be later this week but no later than the following. anyway, thanks for reading, what you guys do here is awesome :D
