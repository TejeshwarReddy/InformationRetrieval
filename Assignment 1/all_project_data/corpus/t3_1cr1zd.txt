I currently have no groceries and no money in my checking, and the credit card is maxed.

I have been working as much as my boss allows while still going to classes and barely affording my rent. I am just looking to feed myself until Monday when my boss gives me my check. 

Once I finish this semester and start my internship in the summer, I am sure I can pay this forward!
