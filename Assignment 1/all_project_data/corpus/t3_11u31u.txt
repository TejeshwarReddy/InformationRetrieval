I'll be hosting a Stargate Marathon this Tuesday, and I've already invested over 70 bucks in it, so if anyone could contribute a pizza, it'd help out a lot.

Do note that I'm not starving or anything, I could simply use a hand in organizing this thing, specially since Pizza is the stereotypical Media Marathon food. Please do help others in dire need before sending me a pie.
