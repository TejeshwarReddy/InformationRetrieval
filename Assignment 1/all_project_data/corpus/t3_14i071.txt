      I'm new to Reddit and a friend a few weeks back told me about this when we were watching YouTube clips about 60 inch pizzas but I could barely believe it existed until I saw it today.

      Sooo basically a few weeks back I had a job interview for some Christmas hours to get money for peoples presents... I was supposed to start on the 3rd but was told I couldn't until I sorted out my work reference. That was all fine and dandy until I call them up 3 days later to see what is going on to only get told they have filled all spots even though they said my job was guaranteed. Oh I also got hit with woman problems this week... PIZZA won't fix things but it'll sure help!
