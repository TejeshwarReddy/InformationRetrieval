My title pretty much sums it up. I would like to send him a pizza sponsored by Reddit. I would love to be ninja like in my attempt to surprise him and his best friend, both of them jamming with their guitars at his home. If you could make this extra nerdy and geeky someway, that would be a HUGE plus! We are a very new couple and just discovered 1 1/2 weeks ago that both of us are Redditors. Despite this blizzard I am stuck at work, and I would rather be with him right now. Anyhow, anybody willing to help out?

EDIT: PastafarianTwit made my night!!!! Pizza is on the way to my boyfriend as we speak. This is so exciting. *doing a happy dance in my office
