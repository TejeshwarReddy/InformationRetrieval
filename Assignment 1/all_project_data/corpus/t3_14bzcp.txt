I can repay you with lovely services. I could of course write you a silly poem, or perhaps create a poster or book cover for you, I could record myself singing a song - very poorly I might add (So that might not be the best option) I can call you on skype and read chapters upon chapters of Fifty Shades of Grey. (That's everyone's favourite, eh?)
