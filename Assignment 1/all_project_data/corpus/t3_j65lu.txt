This stinks... I'm a college student in Normal IL (Illinois State University), but I normally don't have much money for food. I'm living there for the summer because I have a job, but it's part time so almost all of it goes towards rent. Today was a bad day, especially because my friend bailed on driving me over to Sam's Club, and instead offered for wednesday. (my parents let me make grocery purchases up to 50 dollars every 2 weeks). I haven't gone for a month now. All I'm stuck with is frozen vegetables and milk. I'd love to get some decent food for now until wednesday. Pizzerias around here include papa johns, pizza hut and dominos (it's a college town, it has EVERY franchise available).
