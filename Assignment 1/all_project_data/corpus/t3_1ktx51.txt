Recently my roommate and I were both let go from the local hotel where we worked front desk.  We have been struggling to get by as unemployment barely pays enough to cover our basic expenses.  Lately we have eaten a lot of ramen/rice/toast/etc.  As of yesterday we are entirely out of food so today we decided we would try to apply for food stamps.  The application process is a lot of paperwork and processing so hopefully we can get some assistance by next week.  I'm not a fan of asking for handouts but when you haven't eaten in a few days I guess you just have to swallow your pride.  If anyone can help us out we would truly appreciate it and will definitely pay it forward when our financial situation turns around.

**TL;DR**  Sooo poor and sooo hungry.  

Also [here's a picture of my cats!](http://i.imgur.com/2ZNKYAI.jpg) because of well, ya know, reddit.  As a side note despite their owners situation, these kitties are **never** without food.  I would never let a helpless animal suffer because i'm having trouble making ends meet.
