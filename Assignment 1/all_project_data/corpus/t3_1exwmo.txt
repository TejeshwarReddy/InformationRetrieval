Been a particularly long day, been up since 4:30 AM and I am just beat. Really can't afford to spend any extra money right now, but a pizza would be really awesome. I will pay it forward on here when I am able to. Just really can't spend any money right now. In terms of places, I haven't lived in this city to long but I know there is a papa johns.
