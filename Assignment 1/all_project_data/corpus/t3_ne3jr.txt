Having issues with my back so having trouble standing for long periods and on vicodin for a slipped disc that is pressing on a nerve... havent had anything to eat and havent been able to make it to the store with my back and all these meds on an empty stomach is starting to not make me feel too well. Would greatly appreciate a pizza, cant afford one myself since I have no money, last of it spent on copays (have my disability hearing in feb). Sorry if my post if a bit random but kinda loppy at the moment.
