well, My mom is out of town and wont be back for a few more days. . . I had quite a bit of cereals and breads and various boxed foods to last me, and 5 days ago EVERYTHING Got completely infested with bugs.  all the food was pretty much garbage and not safe to eat and I had to get a friend to come help me throw everything out and spray the house down and try to kill all these fuckers off...  but now I have no food, and no money (Bank account is -7328 overdrafted D: ) and I haven't eaten in days. . .  Any generosity would be nice. doesn't even have to be a pizza. Any food delivered would be nice... I'm in canada. I know most food places have cheap salads and various other things.. Anything would be appreciated and i promise to pay it forward as soon as I have money to do so or the chance to! D: ... thanks for your time...
