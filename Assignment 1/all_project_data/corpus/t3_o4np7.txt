I'm 5 months pregnant with no food and i have a 3 and 5 year old. My husband worked through a temp agency and for the week of christmas his work slowed down so we are in a really tough bind with everything. we did get food stamps and i missed my review because i don't have a car. My kids are crying because they are hungry. so if someone could please help us out with a pizza it would really help thankyou and god bless.
