It seems like a lot of requests are from people who had requested repeatedly in the past, sometimes that is all they post on reddit. I would like to give a pizza to a redditor who has contributed lots of non-pizza posts. 

I'll plan on giving the person I choose a pizza tomorrow. PM me :)

EDIT: Thanks for everyone who messaged me. I've picked the pizza recipient! All further entries won't be considered. Have a great day!
