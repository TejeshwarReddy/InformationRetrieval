There isn't anything to eat in my house, and I do mean that. Furthermore I dont have a car or any money to order food, and I have been hungry for hours now. If anyone could find it in their heart to send me a pizza at this time or night, or heck even tomorrow morning i'd be grateful.

Also, I'd draw anything you want to the best of my ability in ms paint.

Im near Toronto, Ontario.
