Hello,

What would you like in exchange for a Pizza Hut gift code? 

We'll take pictures of whatever you can think of, draw, sing, make fools of ourselves in whatever way makes you happy. We are super hungry! We have seven bucks but no gas, so we could walk to Pizza Hut and spend seven bucks on something, but I know it won't feed both of us. You wouldn't guess it by looking at us but we could eat a pizza a piece if some generous member ofr royalty had that kind of money to patronize us with. 

This is barter town, and we are 100% willing to work! 

Please take a chance and send us a PM, you won't regret it!

sorry this sounds so much like an advertisement, we are super hungry and the thought of pizza hut is making us a liiitle bit crazy
