I go to school in Mississippi and haven't had a vegetable in 5 days. Pizza is a vegetable now, right?

Edit: I will get a vegetable pizza and provide pictures to verify pizza's veggie goodness. I think this is a big step for America.

Edit2: Some upvotes but no offers yet. I will also post pics of me SHARING my veggie pizza with a close friend of mine, who is a vegetarian. One large pizza should do the trick between the two of us, so a $15 eGift card or something would work just fine. Also I have paypal linked to my reddit email.

Edit3: Actually, I just won the college drawdown from BOTW. So please don't bother actually sending me anything now :) Much thanks to him for feeding a hungry college student.
