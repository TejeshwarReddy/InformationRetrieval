Hi raop, I'm installing pannels in my room and it's not as easy as I thought, especially that I'm really tired after studying pretty hard for my last exam that takes place next week. If I get good grade (A), I will get scholarship that I need really bad. I was studying for 3 days straight, 2 more are ahead of me. I am very hungry and I don't really know what to eat - I don't want to ask my mom for money because she invested so much in my room lately that it can look as I wanted. Any help appreciated.
