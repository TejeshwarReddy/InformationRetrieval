My ex wife got married yesterday.  It hasn't even been a year since we divorced.  I always believed we'd work things out.  I made lot of desperate attempts in the last month as the wedding got closer topping it off by pouring my heart out and basically begging her not to go through with it.  You can imagine how far any of that got me.  I actually spent yesterday believing I'd get word that she called it off.  I stayed up all night checking her facebook page to see if it happened.  At 8am I finally crashed.  A few hours later I woke up and there was the wedding picture, front and center.  A little bit after that she had her name changed on there, and that was that.  

The last thing I had to eat was a granola bar for breakfast yesterday.  I've got no food in the house, and quite honestly, I've started drinking and driving wouldn't be the best idea.  And you know what?  I'm going to keep drinking.  Part of me knows that I should eat though, or it's going to be that much worse tomorrow.  I've got no money though, no food, but plenty of drink.  I'm going to continue torturing myself tonight, and tomorrow will be a new day.  Tonight I wallow though.  It hurts.

Cheers!

P.S.  Am I the only one who thinks that the first wedding your kids are in shouldn't be one of their parents?
