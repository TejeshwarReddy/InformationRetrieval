Hey everyone...I would be so honored if someone got me a pizza! I'm having a rough time right now. I'm a pre-med student and have a part-time job, but it's only giving me about 4-8 hours a week. By the time I pay my bills (which is pretty hard to do hehe), I have no money left over for groceries. A free pizza would be a lifesaver! Thanks in advance.
