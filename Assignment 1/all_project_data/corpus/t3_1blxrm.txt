Hi,  I am a computer tech representative.  We all know how bad this job can be if you have ever done it.  I am in a place where I have no money and they have failed to pay me recently due to a problem with the system.  I need a pizza to cheer me up and be able to take these calls today.  Please reddit help a fellow techie out by giving me a pizza.

Thanks tech in need.

Edit: I live in Austin, Texas
