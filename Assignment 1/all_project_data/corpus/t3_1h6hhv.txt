Every day I wake up and think, "It's a new day!!" My positivity makes it to the office. I sit down, start working on optimizing our IT environment, check in with a colleague or supervisor, then remember, "NO ONE GIVES A FUCK." The day proceeds to beat that sentiment into me, as well as "nothing you do matters because it will never see the light of day." I waste more and more time on reddit, facebook, forums, whatever as the day goes by. Every time I manage to convince myself to work on something, I just get reminded by someone or some process that it's all fucking pointless busy work to distract me from the fact that this is not the job I interviewed for. By the time 5:00 rolls around, all I can do is shuffle home with that -_- look on my face and fall into yet another chair until it's time to sleep and repeat the same scenario the next day.

I would love something happy and unexpected to happen to me, but as we all know "no one gives a fuck."
