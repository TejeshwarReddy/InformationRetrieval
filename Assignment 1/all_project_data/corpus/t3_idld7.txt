Its kinda hard to ask....I and my wife and 3 kids need a little help.  I lost my job and even though I got another one I dont get paid till next friday. We have been living off anything we can get.  A friend told me about this from tv. I figured I would give it a shot. Not sure how it works.  I would love to feed my kids and wife a decent meal tonight. I am not asking for charity just....well a little food.  I will return the gesture. cowman31@hotmail.com   If you need any other info feel free to email me
