Pathways Home Base Youth Drop In Centre loves the idea of RAOP and would love to receive a generous gift of some pizza one night for our youth who come to the Centre.  We are helping at-risk and homeless youth regain control of their lives with supportive assistance, life skills, employment assistance and counselling.  Anyone willing to offer a pizza in our area - we would greatly appreciate it.  We are only open Mon - Fri until 8pm.  No sob stories, just want to give someone the opportunity to help us help youth.  I know they would love it.  We never get the chance to offer pizza so this is a great opporunity if someone wants to help out.
