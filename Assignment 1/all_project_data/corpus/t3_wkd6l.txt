Hey RAOP'rs!  I lost my job about a month ago, and luckily I found a new one right away.  However, it was a $1/hour paycut AND I only get half the hours I used to get.  I had to use my entire first paycheck to pay utilities, phone bill, and the money I owed on my (store) credit card (good credit &gt; fun things).  

I (luckily) have a pantry full of pasta (I decided that $10/10 boxes of pasta was a good idea a few months ago and that's a lot of pasta) and a few cans of beans and half of a 5lb bag of rice, as well as sauces and syrups for those guys.  I also have a lot of baking things.  I'm definitely not short on food, but it's getting a bit monotonous eating only this, especially since I have to do it 'till next Thursday.

I only have $16 until next Friday's paycheck and I'd like to spice up my life with a treat this weekend!  I live in Minneapolis and I'm in the delivery area of Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Domino's, and a local favorite (though much more expensive), Pizza Luce.  If anyone's willing to order me a medium cheese or pepperoni pizza for carryout or delivery (I can pay tip with the $2 I found on my way home yesterday if it's delivery, or I can bus/bike to pick up from any of those locations!) I would love you forever!  I don't owe rent next month (because I had to pay the last month of rent when I signed my lease) so I will be passing it on as soon as I get my paycheck!

Thanks so much!
