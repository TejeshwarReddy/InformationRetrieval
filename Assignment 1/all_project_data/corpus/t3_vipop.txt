Me and my girl are doing a Juice Fast. You can see my daily entries and workouts at www.juiceoverjunk.com. We have only had Juice and Water for the last 24 days, We started June 1st and will be ending June 30th. We will then be having Vegetables and fruit for the next 15 days to break the fast properly, working our way to solid foods. We have enough money for Pizza, but I was wondering if anyone wanted to treat us and be the person to give us our first Pizza / order out since the fast. That would be sometime around mid July. Sorry if I am doing this wrong. I just been lurking in this subreddit for some time, and thinking pizza this whole month. It would really be cool to participate.

We are in Middle River, Maryland btw.

Thanks in advance all.
