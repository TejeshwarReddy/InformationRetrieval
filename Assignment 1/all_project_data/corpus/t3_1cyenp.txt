I'm in the Pacific Northwest. Yesterday we had a beautiful, cloudless day, and while there's clouds out today - it's bright and shiny and pretty outside.  Could use a pizza to go with the gorgeousity while I'm stuck inside plugging away at a Java Programming I course. And yes I know, that's not a word. Unfortunately I live out in The Sticks (tm) and nobody delivers to me, but I'm willing to drive out and pick up a pizza.  (Dominos has that 7.99 lg pizza carryout deal, which helps)
