Hello RAOP'ers, I'm Galus and I'm from Clearwater, FL. I've been spending my time sitting around hungry for the past couple of days and broke for the last two months. My friend &amp; fellow redditor /user/stevenjohns/ told me about Random Acts of Pizza and I thought I might give this a shot, what can I lose, my pride? School is starting next week and I'm trying to stretch out the last of my money till my scholarships and grants come. Because I've been broke, i've been staying in doing nothing but coding and gaming. I don't know what much more to say other than this is me: http://mariuszgalus.com , in the past week i've been trying to help out my dad's business (not going well) by redo-ing his entire site http://bmhardwoodfloors.net AND my new site (cool css3 stuff! ) http://mariuszgalus.com/newsite which I can't wait to deploy. I also have been coding for 64labs.com but the CEO told me he had no money to pay me. I thought it was my big break to getting a job. In the end, i'm hungry. I just signed up for EBT/food stamps. -_- 
Here's a picture of my bank account http://twitch.tv/saionjik

Have a good day guys
