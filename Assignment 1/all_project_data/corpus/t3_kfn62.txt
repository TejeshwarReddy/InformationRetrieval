Hey RAOP! It's lunch time and I'm hungry.  I have 2 bucks in my bank account but I have the feeling that is going to go to gas so I can get to my new gig on Friday.  I have some vegetable soup, and a can of tuna, and some chocolate chips(?), so its not like I'll starve to death or anything.  I'm just a guy who loves pizza.  I love smelling it, looking at it, eating it, eating it when its cold, eating after heating it up in the toaster oven again so it gets nice and crispy... mmmm...  no expectations, I'll delete this in 2 hours or so if i need to [edit: i won't delete this, apparently that is a bannable offense!].  Thanks everybody, keep up the good work!

EDIT:  Thanks to SarTim I am happy as can be! thanks for reading everybody, and keep up the good work here on RAOP!
