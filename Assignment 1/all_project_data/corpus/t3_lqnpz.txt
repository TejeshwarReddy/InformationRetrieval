Struggling with classes while on academic probation and being faced with a crazy rent hike where the other option is having to devote time to looking for a new place. I have around $6 to my name right now with no idea when I'll get more... could use a pizza to cheer up a bit. Not sure whether anyone will see this, but thanks in advance :)
