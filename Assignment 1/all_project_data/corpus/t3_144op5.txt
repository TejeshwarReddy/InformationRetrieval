Left my GF of two years and moved into a new place, but spent most of my paycheck paying the first months rent. Have less than $15 to my name. Friend was supposed to help me with groceries, but she hasn't received the money from her loan yet, so I'm out of luck until then, or until my next paycheck, which is the friday after next, nearly two weeks away.  
I was hoping someone could help me out, and in return I will mail you one of my [prints](http://imgur.com/a/S5q1Y) when I am financially able. The print would be of your choice.
