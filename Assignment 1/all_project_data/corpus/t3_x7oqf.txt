I'm short on funds until my next paycheck, which doesn't come until next week. I don't get enough hours at my job, I live in such a small town that there aren't many options for a different job. I don't drive, so I can't get myself to the grocery store very often. I've been living on ramen for most of this month. I can't say how much I would appreciate a pizza. I didn't even know this existed, and I feel bad for asking. This isn't what I do. This will be the only time I ever request, that is a guarantee. I hope someone will help me.
