No real sob story; just would love pizza as a reward for surviving my first day back (not to mention that day is 14 hours long).

Cooking later tonight (way later) sounds hellish and I can't afford to eat out or buy my own pizza.

Thank you to anyone who responds; no worries if this doesn't get picked up.
