Anybody in the Belmont/Rockford, Michigan area able to send a pizza to an employee of mine? We have been really slow at work and he's a technician of ours and works as a contractor. We haven't been able to give him any jobs because we've been so miserably slow so we can't afford to pay him. His son's birthday was yesterday and he was going to get his son from his ex-wife today and hang out with him for the day. We were supposed to be able to pay him today but the funds didn't come through from DISH Network (we install DISH) and we won't have money for him until Tuesday. Was wondering if anyone would want to send a pizza his way? Just thought I'd try.
