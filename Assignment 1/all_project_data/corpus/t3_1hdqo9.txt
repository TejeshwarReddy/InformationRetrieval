So some details. I work at this call center and have to deal with people being furious at me for something that I am just now learning about. It can be quite frustrating at times. But you know what would make it better? Some pizza on my lunch break! And I'm broke until Friday unfortunately. Pizza would just make my day! I can send proof of the call center night mare job as well. Thanks to anyone in advance for just looking at this!... Annnddd maybe pizza?

Edit: my lunch starts at 7:15pm MST.
