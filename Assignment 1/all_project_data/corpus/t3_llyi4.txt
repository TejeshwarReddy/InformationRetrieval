YES we just finished running our first ever 5K run around Arthur's seat in Edinburgh!!!! we are pretty knackered and need to regain the calories we lost running up those massive arthur hills in the scottish chilly breeze, my friends ears popped too so the experience wasnt so good for her at times. We would like some pizza please

thank you kindly!
