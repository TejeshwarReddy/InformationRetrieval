Hello!  I have been considering making a request on here for a while so I decided today that I would actually do it!  This was motivated by paying my rent online today and seeing my bank balance shrink (eep), so having one less dinner to worry about would be really nice.  

Right now everything that I am paying is coming out of my student loans since I was unable to find a summer job, and it is stressing me out.  A pizza would just make me feel better! 

I will of course try to pay it forward as soon as I can, let's hope that one of these job applications works out~  Thanks for reading, RAOP!
