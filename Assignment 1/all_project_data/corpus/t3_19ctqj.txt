I'm writing a paper about Minorities in Imperial Germany, and all I've had in my apartment is cans of tuna. I swear to God this fish will be the death of me. 

In return I will answer any burning questions you might have about Poles, Danes, Sorbs, Alsace-Lorrainians, Jews, or Catholics in the years between 1871 and 1918 in the nation of Germany.
