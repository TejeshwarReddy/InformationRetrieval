don't get my check until tuesday evening, a pizza or 2 plus the food we have left here should last til then when im able to get groceries. id ask my parents but i dont want them knowin im in this shitty situation. im goin back to school in the fall so hopefully that will open up more opportunities for us. if someone is fortunate enough to lend some help, id be ecstatic and my son, most importantly, would definitely be as well. message me for verification!!
