Hey all, I found this subreddit the other day and I think it's both hilarious and awesome what goes on here, and I want to participate. 

After months of searching, I received a conditional offer of employment today! I'm very excited to start, but I still have some hoops to get through before I do (the conditions being a background check and drug test, both of which are all clean, so I'm not worried). 

Seeing as how I'm currently a broke college student, pizza is an awesome celebratory food, but I can't really afford it until I start the job. If someone would hook me up with a pizza now, then once I get my first paycheck I would gladly buy them a pizza, or I could pay it forward to someone else listing a request.

I'd also like to make this interesting. I request that the kind, obviously good looking person who does this for me get me their own personal favorite pizza. There are no pizzas I've tried that I don't like, so don't be afraid I won't enjoy it. I promise I will. Or just troll me with the craziest franken-pizza you can design. I think that would be fun too.

EDIT: I'm located in Central Florida
