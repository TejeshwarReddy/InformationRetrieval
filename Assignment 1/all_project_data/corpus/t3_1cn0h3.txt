Let me tell you about the coolest fuckin' rat ever.
He got his name because the first night I got him he jumped straight onto a double cheese pizza from papa johns, like in the damn middle and me and my friends were gassed, so this was hilarious, and hence the name Cheesy Basil. He was a righteous little dude, I'm bummed the fuck out and just miss my boy. He had a tumor on his neck and the vet told me last week there was nothing we could do, I live in central VA and it's a struggle to find help for them.
I gotta give a picture of him to you guys,

He always fell asleep in my lap, like, I won't ever have another little guy quite like him. Still, I had him for 6 years, and he and I had some of the best times ever. He loved to sit on my shoulder while I smoked, and I won't have my best little friEnt with me for 4/20? 
It's just going to be a sad night.
Sorry for my story, I just want a pizza to remember my lil cheesy bastard.
