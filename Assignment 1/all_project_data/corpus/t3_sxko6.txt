It's been hell these last two weeks, and prepping for finals has been kicking my ass. Due to the stress, I've been losing so much weight, I feel like I'm see through! I'm honestly willing to take anything you might want to throw at me, I just really want to wind down and take advantage of my last weekend before finals are slammed right into my face...which would rather be stuffed with pizza.
