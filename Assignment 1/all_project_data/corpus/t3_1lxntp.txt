I'm a student at the University of Arkansas.  There's a gaming lab here on campus called the Student Technology Center.  The staff there does more than just run the gaming lab, though.  They're responsible for tech support all over campus.  These guys work part time, nights and weekends, for minimum wage, and get tons of shit every day from a really thankless and entitled student body.  I wanted to order them some pizza to thank them for what they do, but I'm broke.  Was hoping maybe RAOP could help out.
