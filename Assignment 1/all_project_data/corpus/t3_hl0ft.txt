My dad has helped me out of so many binds that it's not even funny, so when my car broke down I decided it was time for me to try to handle things on my own. At first it was the inner and outer tie rod, then I had a problem with the fan switch, and now it won't even start. I was trying to do things on my own so my dad would be proud of me for fixing things but I've just managed to screw it all up. 

To make a long story short, I have a full tank of gas and I've spent $650 in two weeks trying to get my car running, but it isn't working. I just bought a bus pass to get to work, so I have $3 to my name until Wednesday rolls around, and an empty pantry to keep me company. If a kind stranger was to provide me with a pie, I'll be more than happy to pay back the hungry with my next paycheck. 

EDIT: I'm in Columbus, OH

EDIT 2: The pizza arrived! Thanks raavyn! [It was delicious!](http://www.imgur.com/Lkwsk.jpg) Thank you so much! Look forward to helping someone else out!
