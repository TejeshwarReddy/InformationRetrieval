So I'm new to this but I figured whats the worst that could happen... I just recently got an apartment with my boyfriend and we use all of our money on our rent... I'm extremely hungry and am getting tired of bacon and tater tots... plus the supply is running low... If some would be generous enough to help me out I would be extremely grateful. :)
