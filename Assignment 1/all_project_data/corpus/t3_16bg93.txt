Hi RAOP'ers!  I go to school part time and work full time.  My night class doesn't interfere with my work hours but my daytime class is in the next town over.  Since I work full time and my daytime class takes up a few hours on 2 days of my 8-5 schedule, I use my lunch hours to go to class.  That leaves me with no way to leave work to get anything or go home to fix lunch (which is all I can afford atm :).  

So dumb poor me left the house this morning with no food for lunch and I can't afford to order anything.  Any pie for poor forgetful me? :)
