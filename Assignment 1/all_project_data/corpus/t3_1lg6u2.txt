My SO and I are moving to the new apartment tomorrow which has put us in the poor house (paid first and last months rent upfront) so we currently have a combined total of $0.65

We've been frugal with food, meaning lots of rice and KD, but our dishes / food are packed up and my midnight prego cravings have hit hard. 

And Pizza Pizza closes in an hour. D:

Anyone care to donate a pepperoni pizza? Pretty please!
