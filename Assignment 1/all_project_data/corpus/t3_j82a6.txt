I submit the following as a description of my situation, not a sob story.

I am out of work and freelancing, I wont get paid for another week at least.
A pizza would be my first meal in 2 days, I have been sufficing myself on 25c bags of chips and water. 

Well the chips are done, and I hope you can help.

I am the type who generally helps others, and will certainly pay this forward.

Thanks everyone.
