Last night my friend had a date with a girl. Naturally he wasn't prepared, and I went to his house to clean it. Messy as all hell, had to vacuum and pick up a lot of trash. Had to buy drinks too since there weren't any and condoms. Long story short my friend doesn't close. Turns her down and wants to "Take it slow." 

Now I'm broke and hungry, just want a pizza or something, haven't eaten all day.
