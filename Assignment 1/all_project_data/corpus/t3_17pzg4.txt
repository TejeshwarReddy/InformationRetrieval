Basically, like the title says, I got paid yesterday, and after putting gas in the car and paying rent, I have $1 dollar to my name and no groceries. I start a new job Monday, with a big increase in pay, so I won't struggle like this anymore. When I get the first paycheck, I'll pay it forward to the person who helped me or to someone else on here. 

I'm in Southern Indiana. 

Thanks!
