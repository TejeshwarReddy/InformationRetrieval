So lately Reddit, i've been lurking a lot. I've given pizza to Constructor who is a close personal friend whom I talk to often. I've always been a giver... Never one to ask for much of anything.

Lately its just been a series of downfalls for me. First to start, my girlfriend left me around october. Right after I got a new job, that was fun. Getting put into the mental ward at the hospital cuz I got so damn depressed that I was gonna kill myself.

The second to come was the reapearance of the scabies i've been trying to get rid of that my ex girlfriend had given to me. She caught them SOMEWHERE and i'm STILL not sure how she got them. The Medicine costs a fortune and i was lucky to get the first tube for pretty much free, but then I lost my insurance.

I've been trying and trying, day after day to make myself feel better - gifting people things like games on steam, pizza to close friends and helping other people like my coworker Ryan whom has a kid and a wife and always eats raman for his break because he's dirt broke all the time.

I don't know what it is, and I sit here, hungry myself, cold cuz I don't have heating in my house because I heat it with propane and I don't even have enough money for that.

On top of it all, today i'm sitting here in pain because on my way to work (which i'm missing today due to this) I got hit by a car. I ride a bike so... You can kinda imagine what thats like. My back rim is mangled, luckily the person who hit me bought me a new rim and got me a ride home, but fuck. I'm just like... STOP THIS NONSENSE!

So all i'm asking for is some pizza guys. Anyone, it don't matter, small pie, it's whatever.

I live in the New Jersey area in Mantua. Pats pizza is my favorite, but i'll go for pizza hut cuz I like most of their stuff too.


Thanks in advance for just reading. :)
