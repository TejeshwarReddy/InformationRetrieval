[Pizza received]

Believe it or not, my *parents* bailed on me for dinner tonight! Remarkable! And I don't get my refund from school until late April, but willing to repay the favor then. :)

I'd love to wash down my sorrows with a cheese pizza!

edit: A friend of mine IRL has seen his post and is sending me a pizza. Thank y'all!
