Don't know where to start. My brother tried to commit suicide last Tuesday by ODing on the antidepressants he was just given by his psychologist.

I live about 300 miles away from home with my girlfriend currently. I only have intermittent part time work and just visited last weekend, so I'm too broke to go home again right away.

It hurts so bad thinking of him locked up in the facility, though my family can visit him 1 hour a day, and I call every day right after they're through to check up on him. Sounds like they've got him diagnosed but we have no idea when he's getting out.

This is half just to vent, I guess. Nothing is fun right now. I'm completely disinterested in my hobbies.

I know it's unreasonable, but I feel guilty when I'm having fun because I know he can't.

I wish someone could send him a pizza.

EDIT: If anyone's been in a facility for this before and wouldn't mind telling me what it was like, feel free to PM me.Thanks

EDIT2: I wasn't quite clear, I wanted to give him the pizza when he gets out. I'm happy to provide verification as well (I assume he'll work with me a bit in giving you guys like a hospital slip of some sort).

EDIT3: Verification for anyone who's interested, and wants to see the admission slip: http://imgur.com/fCkEnHK,eLaTaLI

He's coming home today or tomorrow.

Thanks everyone for the support.
