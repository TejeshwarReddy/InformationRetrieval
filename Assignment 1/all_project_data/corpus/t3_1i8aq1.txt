There's not much more to add than that. I'm unemployed and my mum kindly takes care of me however she can. Unfortunately she's only able to get part time retail hours, so money is always pretty tight. This month, there's been dramatically less overtime available, which in our house unfortunately means dramatically smaller/fewer meals.

It would be nice to surprise her with something nice for once!
