tomorrow, my wife and i are going before a judge to let him decide if our bankrupcy case is valid. we've had a really tough time of things through this, but tomorrow is the light at the end of the tunnel.

we would love to have a pizza dinner just to ourselves to get our spirits up and ready for the fight we'll have tomorrow.

thanks to all who read this.
