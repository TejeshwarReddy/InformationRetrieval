I heard about this website online and I hope that someone out there can help me. My husband and I haven't had alot of money coming in, he's been driving me all over hell and high water and of course gas is expensive. I'm 7 months in, to his credit, he has been pretty good about my cravings, even getting up at 3 AM to make a taco run (of course he ate more of them than I did). Today I have been craving a cheese pizza with a little barbecue sauce on the side like crazy. With my families budget, we just don't have enough to buy a pizza. And I hate to say it, but I'm in full bitch mode. Not just for me, but for his sake can anyone help us out? I know I've been giving him hell all day. I haven't seen him in a while, I think I scared him off the last time. I know he's in there wrapping pennies, but there's no way there's enough. I'm in Springfield, MA.
