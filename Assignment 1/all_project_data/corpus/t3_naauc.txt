I would really appreciate any help that someone can offer. I am with two friends studying for our last nursing final, tomorrow morning. Graduation is so close and yet money seems to continue being a month to month struggle. Again, anything will be greatly appreciated!

P.S.
I told my friends about reddit and they had never heard of it. I showed them how it works and how entertaining it is. They love it, but they don't believe that random acts of pizza actually occur. I even showed them pictures, but they won't believe me. Anyone want to help me out with proving how awesome reddit really is too?
