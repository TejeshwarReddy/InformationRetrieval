Hey Reddit,
We're 3 brothers currently freelancing in web design/development and as for now don't have a penny to our name, in fact, quite the opposite of negative pennies.
We'll be willing to do web development, illustration or graphic work of your choosing for pizza or we can come up with something for you.
FYI we're located in the UK
Cheers

EDIT: the offer is still open as mr-smor was unable to order online for us due to geographical location and no stores accepting paypal. 
Thanks again mr-smor.
