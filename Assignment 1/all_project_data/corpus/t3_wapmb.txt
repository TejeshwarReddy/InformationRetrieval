Well, they say when things get worse the shit hits the fan. Well in my case the shit hit the fan, the fan blade let loose, and smashed into my damn window!

Lost my job, bank account is under, Lost all of my groceries i just bought when the power went out, and my car is acting like its gonna kick the bucket.

All that being said, being I have no food, I sure could use a tasty pizza. At least the only thing good about my day could be what lies in my stomach.
