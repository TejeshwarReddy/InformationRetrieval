I've had a horrible week so far and just found out today that I won't be getting my financial aid disbursement till the first week of March. I could really use a pizza to chow down on tonight instead of staring at my pantry deciding on ramen noodles, or ramen noodles to eat. 

EDIT: This is just a throwaway I made, I don't want my friends to think they have to help me anymore then they already have. PM me and I can give you my main name if you want to look into my posting history.

Thanks
