My little girl is asking for two things for her birthday in two weeks. a Princess cake and PIZZA!!! ( she bounces when she asks for pizza!) I feel horrible not being able to take her to chucky cheese like she would really like. Myself and my two children live off less then 500 a month and that's is gross. Nothing taken out for bills and things first. Pizza or going out to eat in general is a true treasure and treat! If Anyone is able to help make one little girls 4th birthday a little more special we would be more thankful then you could ever know! I want to throw her a real party! Have friends and family over to our home for a change! To see her eyes light up would be the greatest gift ever! Thank you so much for your time!
