Times have been tough the last few months and my girlfriend has been such a trooper through it all. We are getting back to stability, but hit a snag this weekend. Won't have grocery money till Tuesday at the earliest. The pantry is dangerously low on supplies and we won't be able to eat much tonight other than a few old tortillas.

Her and I would greatly appreciate your kindness and a hot meal. We are the type of people to pay such kindness forward. We don't need much, a pepperoni from Dominos would be like hitting the lottery right about now.

Thanks for any consideration you may give to our situation. 

[BONUS CAT PIC AS A THANK YOU](http://imgur.com/7kf9avG) These are our two cats, Setzer and Reyes. We've also got a stray kitten that come to our back porch that we've been helping out by feeding and giving fresh water to her. We are planning on getting her shots and taking her in as one of our own as soon as we get back on our feet financially.
