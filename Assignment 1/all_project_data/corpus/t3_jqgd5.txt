My girlfriend's going in to hospital midday tomorrow for a certain "procedure", which means as of this morning she's fasting and only permitted to consume clear liquids. I'm unfortunately out of work and in recent weeks she's been working hard to support the both of us and I'm really grateful and proud of her and would love to treat her once this is over tomorrow evening, but the sad fact is that I simply can't afford to do so. Help me to give her a small treat that I feel she deserves.
