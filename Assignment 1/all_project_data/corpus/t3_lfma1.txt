I don't have a steady job right now and I've been doing odd jobs to get by. I'm home alone for the next month by myself because my dad is traveling for company who hired him for a month of solid work which is awesome and my mom is away visiting her mom. I've been doing everything I can to make some money recently because I'm trying to visit my girlfriend who is down in Florida right now. I'm planning to go out and see her just after my birthday on the 27th and need to have as much as possible to be able to stay in a hotel (where she is staying you're not allowed to have guests overnight) and to eat and pay for the plane ticket back. So, I ask you Random Acts of Pizza, could you spare a few dollars for a pizza for an early birthday present?

Here is a photo of me and my refrigerator:

Feel free to ask me anything and I will definitely take pictures to thank you for the pizza!
