She lives in Round Lake Beach, Illinois, which hasn't been hit super hard by the recession but certainly isn't doing well. She works as a waitress for a restaurant that just opened, and it's not doing too well. It's looking like she's gonna be unemployed soon. She's down to a day a week, and unfortunately I'm not in a position to help her out with food. A random pizza will help her eat something other than the stale remains of a box of wheat thins til her boyfriend gets back home to her on Monday.

EDIT: Thank you so much, Reddit. You made her week for sure!
