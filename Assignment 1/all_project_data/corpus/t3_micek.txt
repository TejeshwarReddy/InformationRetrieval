I never thought I would end up here, pleading my case for a pie on Reddit. But alas, I must succumb to the forces of hunger and humbly extend a request to the hearts behind the 'Alien'... Here I sit in my girlfriends apartment alone, as she is away visiting Montreal, without a dime to my name nor a can in any cupboard. I am broke until pay-day which is three days away, and I have been making due in the meantime. If anyone is kind enough to buy me a pizza, I would be certain to reciprocate and pay it forward once I get my pay cheque.
Edit: I am located in Toronto
