I'm just a poor college kid begging for hand-outs.  I've been out of a job for a month and a half and haven't had much luck yet (not for lack of trying or interviews).  To qualify for food stamps (which I was using) you must work 20 hrs. a week if you're in school, at least, so I didn't get that this month and I'm broke.  I would love something greasy and cheesy (and mushroomy?) that is not canned black beans and white rice.

I can offer silly drawings in paint, help build something in Minecraft, perhaps even your own song if you can wait a week... make that two weeks (I'm kinda sick and don't really have a singing voice right now)....

Anyway, I also need a tablet, but pretend it's a really good drawing of me and comparably pathetic to a sad puppy: http://i.imgur.com/7EqsN.png

Edit: I live in central Wisconsin, US.
