I am not sure about sites like these but my neighbor told me about this website so I figured I would give it a try. I am a single pregnant mother of 1 child will be 2 when this one is born. A couple of weeks ago my husband decided he wanted to be with his ex so he left and went back to  her and left us alone. He has not paid one cent in child support since he left. I had quit working so I could go back to school in March so I do not have a job which makes it hard on me. I am looking for a job everyday but no luck yet. I would love to have one night where I do not have to worry about what to feed my son and myself. If someone can help me with pizza I would appreciate it very much. We only have a pizza hut here and I do not have a car so I can not go pick it up it will have to be delivered so I know you have to have a 12.00 order to get delivery. Thank you to anyone who can help me.
