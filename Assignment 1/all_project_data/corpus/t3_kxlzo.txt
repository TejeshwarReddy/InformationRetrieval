Tons of people wish they could come and support this effort but can't because of work or location, but it's incredibly easy to google a pizza place that will deliver to the protesters!

For Boston...
Send the pizza(s) to Dewey Square (Boston financial district, right outside South Station).  The logistics team or general donations can be dropped off along the John Fitzgerald prkway by the trees.
