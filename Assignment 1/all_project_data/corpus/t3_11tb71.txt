Warning: Sob story. Sorry :-/

For starters, sorry for using a throwaway account, but my situation is beyond embarrassing. Posting on my main won't do any good, I don't have any friends, much less anyone that knows me and likes me enough to help out. I understand if you choose to not help because of this, but I can also do my best to provide any proof you'd like within reason.

To keep it short and sweet, I don't have a place to stay right now. I have 2 degrees, recently graduated, but I did something stupid during my first year of college, and have a misdemeanor on my record that I believe has been preventing me from obtaining employment. I have been trying to save up to get it expunged but recently lost the retail job I did have over some really silly shenanigans (boss with nothing better to do than fire people). I managed to land a job interview this week, and was just notified I made it to round 2 on Monday, for a really decently paying position.

I lived check to check, so as of today I'll be living out of my car for 2-4 weeks until a good friend of mine moves into town, who's going to let me stay with him. Food and money is scarce, no way to make ramen anymore, so it'll probably be the dollar menu for a while. I've got one tank of gas to last me. Could someone toss a papa john's gift card my way? They're all over town... I'd be eternally grateful! I can't post on /r/loans because I don't know when I'll be able to pay back, and no way of preparing food from /r/foodpantry, so I figured this is the only assistance subreddit that could really help, even if only a meal for the weekend. 

Well, that was not so short and sweet. Sorry... again &gt;_&lt;.

ps: If anyone knows of a way to make quick buck besides prostituting myself, please let me know. I'd be happy to do anything
