Every day we eat peanut butter sandwiches, cheapest of the cheap hot dogs, ramen noodles or rice. We are currently about to walk (no car --long story of bad luck) over two miles in 95 degree weather to overdraft our $8 balance bank account in order to buy food for the week. I'm the last person who would ever ask for anything, and perhaps that is why we have lived in such rough shape for so long, but I figured I would give it a shot. Maybe it will delay another day and something will come along. Thanks in advance for helping us, or for any who considered..

UPDATE:
People are amazing. We have had some wonderful people offer us assistance. Thank you to those who have helped and those who have offered. We received a Random act of Dominos from the one and only flamingcow. We also will be receiving a grocery gift card soon from another wonderful person. Again, we're taken back by the generosity. We're not used to receiving such gifts. There are amazingly good people out there.

P.S. - I can only hope that we can be as generous to others once things have turned around for us.

MORE EDITS:
Wow people have been generous to us, we just got another gift of Pizza Hut today completely unexpected! Thank you very much! (I'm not sure if they want to be named publicly so I won't do so unless I have their permission). We can't wait to be good enough financially to be able to give the gift of pizza/food to others in need in the future!
