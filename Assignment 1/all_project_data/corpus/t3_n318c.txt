I have no particular need for a free pizza. I just have a want. I can afford a pizza and don't have any children or other dependants, besides my turtle Donny, who will get a pepperoni if a pizza should be bestowed upon us. 

I just like pizza and like the idea of receiving a free pizza via some random person. I suppose it would be proper of me to reciprocate in the future, and who knows, maybe I will. 

Cheers
