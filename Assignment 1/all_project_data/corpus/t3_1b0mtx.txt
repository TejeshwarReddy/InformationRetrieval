My partner is a wonderful gender-queer pansexual and after six-months I am still enamored. We live in the Barrio of North West Dallas and love-it. While I looked for a tech support job, my partner bit the bullet and took a burger job (albiet, fancy burger place; they refer to it as eco-capitalist.)

We would love a pizza with meat on it (although we are queer activists we do not dabble in granolaheadary.) 

What you will get in return: we will personally write you a thank you card and send you a pizza in return. I will make my personal number available to your elderly relatives; so that I can tell them to unplug their router and restart their Windows 98 when their internets aren't firing.
