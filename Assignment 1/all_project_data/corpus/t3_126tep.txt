I must leave the house I'm at in a few days. I don't have a place to go from here and haven't had the money for an actual filling meal in a while. I'm nervous about what's going to happen, but I'm also just thinking about my stomach too. I don't think I can eat another bite of Ramen or dollar store mac and cheese today. If anyone could help me I appreciate it beyond imagination. I would also save someone else once I land on my feet. I believe in Karma and sending it forward. Thanks for reading my woes.
