Just what the title says. Husband and I both decided to quit smoking. I went cold turkey, he got the gum. Its been 5 days so far. Food cravings and munchies have kicked in though. I'd love some hot gooey pizza goodness right now. We have Domino's and Pizza Hut. I can pay it forward soon as I get paid, since I'm not spending $40 a week on smoking now!
