Hi

   We're moving today and with fronting for the new deposit, paying for tuition at Davis, and double rent...we're tapped out. We have already had issues today- budget screwed up our rental truck and we had to drive 30 miles away to pick up a replacement and our new apt was dirty so now we are waiting on a cleaning service to sort that out! We got two friends to help us (with 2 kids I can't help my husband much) but we need to feed them! Could somebody help us out with a couple of pizzas today?
