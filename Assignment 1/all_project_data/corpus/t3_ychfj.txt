Broke until Sunday, no food, no money, (all of what we did have went to our babies! [dogs, cat, snake...]) sitting at work and hungry as fuuuuh. We are broke as hell and craving some 'zaa. If someone would be kind enough to get us a pizza from Papa Johns or Dominos or Pizza Hut, (our favourites!!!) or anywhere really! we would be forever indebted to RAOP and on Sunday, when we get paid, we would totally pay back the favor to another in need!!! Thanks so much!!
