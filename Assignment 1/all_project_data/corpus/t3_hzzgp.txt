Hey all lost my job a little over 8 months ago, finally got a new one that I start the 4th of next month. My bank account is negative, and the only way I have survived is food stamps, which I get again this Friday. Anyone want to send me a Papa John's pizza (only chain that will deliver here) In STL City, you will help me eat until I get food on Friday!
