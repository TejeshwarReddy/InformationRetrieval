(First time on RAOP so sorry if i messed up the format/rules)

I'm currently down on my luck due to my roommate moving out, and my cat getting really sick (She ended up having hyperthyroidism (Damn rare in cats, i won the sick cat lottery!)) [picture of the sick kitty](http://i.imgur.com/PPAW8.jpg). 

She's doing just fine right now thankfully. Though the medication is 58$/m (and thats if they are nice and drop the visit fee like they did last time which in of itself is 43$) until they get the dosage right then back down to 20~$/m (depending on dosage, probably be a bit more, i'm expecting 34$/m if the current dosage works)

I'm just wanting a pizza or two i can eat to raise my spirits (it's the even last finals week for my bachelors! Damn you Murphy's Law) and have something tasty eat while i try and de-stress and work on getting another job while
