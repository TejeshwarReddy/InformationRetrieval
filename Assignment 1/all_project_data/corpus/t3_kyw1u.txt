Ok I am a college student and I live in a dorm but I don't have any money and I have been starving for 2 days already. The only way I'm not on the floor dying of hunger is because I have been drinking a LOT of water. I do have a job but most of that money goes towards paying for the school and the rest for food but I get payed next friday. I would really appreciate it if someone would buy me a pizza and when I do get payed then I will gladly return the favor.
