Okay here's the deal:

A friend of mine has agreed to be the Foster Mother for a Dog in need... However, the organization has all of the sudden burdened her with the costs of Flea and Parasitic Removal treatments, costing over $200!! Normally a Foster agency will cover these costs but this particular one says those fees aren't included in their reimbursement policies... Instead of turning it down and returning the dog she paid to have the dog cured of it's problems like a truly selfless person!

She's currently in a bind and is trying hard to get through the next week just feeding herself until pay day since she's been hit by these unexpected fees. If anyone is in a better situation it would be great if we could surprise this animal lover with a Random Act of Pizza!!!!
