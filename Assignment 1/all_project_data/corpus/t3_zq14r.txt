My boyfriend introduced me to reddit a while back. I'm from Finland and I have only 0,27 cents in my bank but I'd like to surprise him with a pizza since he's been having a rough week, and also has no money to get anything to eat. I wonder if anyone here would be able to help, I'd appreciate it a lot.
