Here is my story. I have a 3 year old kid, and due to some bad budgeting this month. I am out of food for the next few days. My son is or course more important than me, and so I've been scraping together what I have to feed him, but I haven't eaten more than a few chocolate covered nuts at work since sunday. 

Thought I would give this a try, hoping for the best.
