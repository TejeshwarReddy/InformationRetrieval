I don't really know how this works, I just found out about this subreddit,  but basically I'm a broke college student living with my boyfriend, who (he, not I) earlier this month became unemployed. I would love to surprise him tonight with something other than rice or ramen noodles, even if only to lift his spirits just a little bit. Hopefully somebody here could help me do that for him.
