We all woke up this morning feeling absolutely horrible. The two kids especially the youngest just want to cuddle with me all day. My a/c is having trouble keeping the house cool below 80 and it would make it worse for me to use the oven to cook since they're running fevers. I'm having financial trouble at the time but I hope one day I can repay someone with a pizza too! Thanks!
