I am a legit redditor with a few jobs and a good set of morals and values. This last couple weeks have been very tough...all the money I made went to pay bills, rent, getting my driver's license back and the  state government took money from my account to repay for past due state taxes. I am very hungry and desperate please help. No family here in the US to help me and I feel bad asking friends for food money. Please help me and I will replay as soon as I get my money right.
