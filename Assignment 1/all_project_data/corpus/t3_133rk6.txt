Hey everyone!
I couldn't access my other account, but anyway

- I lost access to my bank funds and will not be able to purchase anything until payday (this Friday)
- I've got 3 tests this week and I work roughly 30-35 hours a week... I typically eat about a meal a day (no fast food, just home cooked)
- I have some rice, beans and some ground beef in the fridge that I attempted to cook... But this was the [result](http://imgur.com/X3wwk). Burnt like hell. Tastes worse than it smells.

Nothing too serious, just a series of first world problems. I'd really appreciate any help! I'll be sure to return the favor this Friday.

Thanks!

Edit: Also, I'm in Denton, TX.
