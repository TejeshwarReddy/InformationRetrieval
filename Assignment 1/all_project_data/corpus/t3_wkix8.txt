Hi RAOP

I had to scrounge up what ever money I could find so I could get my dogs some dog food today. They ran out of dog food yesterday. The fridge is empty and I wont be getting any money till Tuesday. Can someone help out a guy and his two dogs? I'll share some with my dogs. I' sure they would love a slice, instead of eating that cheap dried stuff.
