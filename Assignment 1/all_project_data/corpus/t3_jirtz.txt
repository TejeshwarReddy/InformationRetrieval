Hey y'all.  I'm a video producer in Chicago and my biggest client yet decided he wanted to use the work I gave him and not pay for it.  I've spent ALL day today and yesterday looking for work just so I can put some food in my refrigerator.  Rent and utilities are covered, but I haven't had a "real" meal in over a week.  Dominos sounds so incredibly good right now for my belly and attitude towards the human race.  

Anyway, I am willing to make some motion graphics or logo designs.  I will work for my pie!  Peace.
