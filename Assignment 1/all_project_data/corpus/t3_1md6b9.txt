No car and I refuse to waste money on gas station food when we were supposed to go tonight. But surprise surprise my friend dicked out on me again. So monday is soonest I will be able to take bus to the giant. Nothing in house except flour, lemonade mix and rice for next 2 days.

Someone make my day?
