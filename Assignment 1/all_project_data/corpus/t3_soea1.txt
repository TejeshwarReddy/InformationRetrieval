I've been out of work as I try and get some medical issues taken care of. Fighting with both my old employer and the government, jumping through hoops, etc. Can't complain for the most part, managing to just barely make rent in my basement bachelor apartment, etc. but no budget left for finer things in life like pizza. Been a long time since I had one, hoping to recapture the flavour. :)
