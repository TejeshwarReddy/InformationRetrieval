Hey RAOPers, today's been a pretty shitty day. I've been suffering from depression all semester long, and it's really affected my school work. I found out from our disabilities services counselor that I won't be able to pass two of my classes this semester. I also had a really shitty therapy session today that mainly resulted in a lot of crying. I hate to post a sob story, but a pizza right now would do a lot to cheer up my night, but I'm also really low on cash. I get paid next Friday, and I promise I'll pay it forward after getting my paycheck. Thanks so much!
