Back at school, but both school and my job don't start for another week. Not enough money for heat, so I've been 
crashing at my friend's girlfriend's house. I would love a hot meal, if someone felt like sharing. 

EDIT: I have been generously taken care of by the enigmatic jetboyterp. If you were thinking about helping, please send your money to another redditor in need!
