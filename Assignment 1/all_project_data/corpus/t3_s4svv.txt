Need some help to get to payday. Almost completely out of food. mac and cheese, rice, and bread is what is left. I live with my three brothers and my father. My father will get paid Friday and and we are eating at a family's house tomorrow. My brothers have full paid week lunch cards for school.

I have gotten a pizza before like 6 months ago and it really helped us out. Just need a little help to get us to payday. Thanks
