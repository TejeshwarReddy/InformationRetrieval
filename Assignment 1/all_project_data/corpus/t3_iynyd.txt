I recently went through some problems, and a friend of mine here has taken me in. He is just as broke and works his ass off to take care of both of us. I'm looking for work, but It would be nice to give him something in return. He was just saying to me how much he would love a pizza.

If you can help, it would be very appreciated. I'll send a pic with the pizza and my friend. :)

(I have a verification code also.)
