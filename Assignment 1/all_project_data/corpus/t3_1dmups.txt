Hello, I am 24 years old, I am a full time worker, a full time college student, and i live all on my own, not easy to do but i manage. Its the end of finals I am broke, at home with pink eye, so i can't work today (not my choice) and i'm broke. I would really like some pizza. If any of you can help me i would be extremley grateful. Thank you.
