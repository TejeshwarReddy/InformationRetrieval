Not sure why it's Pizza Hut in particular, but this craving has been driving me insane for the past two weeks.  And unfortunately I got into a small accident last weekend, so any money I come across has to go toward repairing my car.  If some kind soul could bless me with a large pizza or send me a Pizza Hut gift card I will return the favor as soon as I can, either to the donator or to someone else in need (their choice).  I'm having bloodwork done tomorrow in the same town with the Pizza Hut, so I can pick it up then!  That would make my week.  Possibly my month, since the whole car thing was quite shitty.

Edit: Crap I forgot to mention in the title, I'm in New Hampshire!

**UPDATE:** I was able to use afshin's gift card and had enough to get both a large stuffed crust pizza AND cinnamon sticks!  Here I am post pizza pick-up.  http://i.imgur.com/pyUuc.png  I couldn't wait and started eating in the parking lot haha.  Once LHtheXF's gift card shows up I will donate it to another redditor. :)

Thanks again you guys are amazing!
