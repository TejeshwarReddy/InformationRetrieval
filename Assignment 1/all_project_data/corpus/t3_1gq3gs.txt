I've had a very rough couple of months. Finally got me a another job and my job even loaned me cash to buy another car right after starting after the transmission went out in my other. With getting caught up on bills, paying back the loan as quick as I can, I have been doing pretty good money wise. After almost 1/2 my check goes to child support, my daughters mother called saying they didn't have food. She doesn't work or do anything to get money except live off my child support(shes perfectly fucking healthy by the way...). She is to prideful to get any assistance either. I kept $30 for gas in my bike and car(I don't work far and both get decent mileage) and went to the grocery so my daughter and her brother(8 years old, not mine) have food to eat. I can pay it forward when I get paid and will be glad to!
