Hey, me llamo David, and I attend Full Sail University Online and live in Florida.  My living expense check is sent out on Thursday, but my roommate doesn't get paid until Friday, so I was wondering if someone could gift us a pizza?  I can return the favor in a week or two, or I'll pay it forward to someone else.  

There are some pretty good deals for large pizzas here at our local pizza hut.  I'm easy to appease.  Don't even need any toppings if it's cheaper. 

Thanks ahead of time.  Raaaaawr.  I'm fluent in velociraptor, and that was "thank you".  Or "you smell of feet", those two phrases are pretty tricky.  

Also, my bank account, for your viewing pleasure. Mock the poor boy.

EDIT: So it kinda sounds like I want a bunch of pizza.  Just one.  We don't eat much, so it should last until tomorrow.
