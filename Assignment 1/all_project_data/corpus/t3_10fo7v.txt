I just finalized my enlistment in the US Air Force, and I'd love to celebrate with my fiancee/soon-to-be-wife. Alas, my bank account is running on fumes. Would anyone care to help us out tonight?

I'm in eastern Los Angeles County; I have Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Papa Johns near me. I have a verification code, too!
