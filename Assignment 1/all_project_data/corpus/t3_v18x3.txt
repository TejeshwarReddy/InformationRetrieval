I just found this subreddit and I'm super pumped. But the problem is the only pizza place in Kent, Ohio that I still know is open closes in 8, now 7 minutes. I didn't eat dinner tonight cause I was planning on ordering food after my last paycheck cleared at midnight, but for some reason it didn't go through and now I have no money to order food. This would be a great help, nay, a miracle if somehow this works out. Thanks a million.

Edit: Just found out Gyro doesn't close until 3! An extra hour on the clock, this would still be awesome!

Edit 2: Only 15 minutes left. I should have expected 2am to be subprime pizza wishing time. 

Edit 3: Oh well, I figured this was too good of an idea to actually work. Apparently one of the mods has taken it upon himself to personally cut off any potential pizza supply tonight for who knows what reason, and it's just about 3 so nooo Gyro. Sorry Random Acts of Pizza, I was so ready to pay it forward.
