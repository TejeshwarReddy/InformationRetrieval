Hey all,

I recently tore the ligament in my left shoulder (two nights ago) and I am now stuck in my apartment. I am (like so many others) a broke college student who now has to pay for these medical expenses, and I find myself somewhat down in the dumps as I cannot hang out with my friends or do anything productive as I am hopped up on vicodin all day and night. 

I could really use a small pick me up, maybe in the form of a pizza? :) 

I plan to return the favor to the other needy posters here in this subreddit as soon as my shoulder heals :)
