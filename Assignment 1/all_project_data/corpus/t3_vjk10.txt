I have a huge hankering for pizza, but because of my poor self-control (whoops!) in following my budget in my new monthly-paying job, I'm running on change until Friday.

I have been craving pizza for a while now, but have been holding off for a long time because of my weight loss goals. Now that I've lost 50lbs (thanks /r/keto!), I'm giving myself a little leeway.

I think this subreddit is an awesome idea. Folks don't always need a good reason to want a pizza, and sometimes it's nice to indulge the cravings of others. I will most certainly throw up an offer this weekend, regardless of whether I'm gifted one here.

Cheers and good luck, fellow pizza-seekers!

PS: I will also gladly record voicemail greetings (and other similar stuff) with my velvety voice to show my gratitude. Here's one I did a couple years ago on the street for a random person: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7shkhGnPVZo
