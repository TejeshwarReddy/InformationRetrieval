My uncle works for himself doing grocery store refrigeration. I moved to Denver around June 1st, and I'm looking for work. I worked with him **2** weeks ago last, for about a week and a half. I even went to Oklahoma City with him to help build a giant walk in cooler and set the cases in the store - the ones customers use.

He left for Modesto CA, 2 weeks ago to do another, and he gets back home tomorrow, and he may or may not have a paycheck waiting for me, but I will find out then.

I'll return the favor when I've been compensated, I appreciate the help! d:D

EDIT: A huge thank you to the incredible outofthewoods. d:D
