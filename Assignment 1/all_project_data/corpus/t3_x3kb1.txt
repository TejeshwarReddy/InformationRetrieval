Me and my fiancee have been spending a lot recently combining Arbitrary day, cleaning supplies, steam sale, and just being really busy as of late.. so if someone could toss a pizza our way it would be much appreciated.

As compensation, you can appear as a background character in my webcomic [Antihero for Hire](http://antihero.keenspot.com), possibly running away from some sort of monster or other.

And we'll be sure to pay it forward when we get paid next!
