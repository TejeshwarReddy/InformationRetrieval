Hello, long-time lurker here.  I have been eating things out of cans for about the past week and some meaty, cheesy, hot pizza would be amazing.  I will have money by next Wednesday so that I can get some non-canned food, but for now, I'm pretty hungry.  It's finals/report/project season and I'm super stressed out.    

More background info: college student in California, third year of my undergrad, broke until next week, etc.  

I promise to put up pics once I receive my delicious circle of food.  Also, an e-gift card is preferred because I am about to head to school and I am not sure when I'll actually order the pizza.  PM me and I'll give you my email.  We have Domino's and Pizza Hut around where I am.  

Once again, thanks so much!  (God) Bless you!
