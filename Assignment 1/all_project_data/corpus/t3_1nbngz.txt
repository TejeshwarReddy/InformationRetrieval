Recently got laid off from my job. Only have hot dogs in the house and no money coming in for 2 days... Kindness and a pizza would really brighten my day.  Will pay it forward as soon as I can.

EDIT: /u/roxieh tried but being from the UK caused some issues... any US redditors out there with a heart of gold?

UPDATE: would still really appreciate a pizza :)
