As the title suggests, I will make a brand new instrumental track or remix  
right now, any genre, sample something, remix something, etc. for pizza.  
I'm pretty good at it. If you're disappointed, then no pizza for me.

I'm just broke, bored, hungry and on crutches.  

Edit: I'm in Northern California.
