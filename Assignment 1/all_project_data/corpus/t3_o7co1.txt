That's it.  Been sick all week... called out during the week but had to work today - 12 hours.  Husband has been laid off.  House guest is staying with us for a couple days before he goes to an ashram for several months.  I'm tired and really don't want to have to cook dinner tonight after my commute home... but also don't have the cash available for take out.  Will spread your kindness!
