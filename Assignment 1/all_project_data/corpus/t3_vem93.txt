Welp, this week the Federal payment system mixed me up with someone who got half of his pay revoked this month.

The good news is that I get payed 150% next paycheck. The bad news is that I didn't know I was only 50% until I got notified by my bank yesterday. A Pizza from Dominoes would certainly help me cheer up and save the last bit of dough I have (pun intended) to make it to the end of the month.

If done, in July I will pay that shit forward!
