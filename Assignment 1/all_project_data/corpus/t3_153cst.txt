My boyfriend and I are moving to a new neighborhood and this is our last night in our current house. We've got almost everything moved, and are consequently very broke and have been munching on Triscuits, as we aren't able to go food shopping until Friday. A large pizza would set us up for today and tomorrow!

We were thinking about what to do for our tummies and I remembered: Random Acts of Pizza! I've never done this before so I'm pretty excited. PM me for more info. I will send you a picture of us with the pizza and one of our cat Sid the Squid doing something *very* silly. One does not regret pictures of Sid the Squid.
