Hey. Ive read the whole side bar and [this website](http://www.randomactsofpizza.com/index.html). As a Redditor for well over 3 years, Ive known about this community for a long time but this is the first time Ive ever posted here. Before I continue, I just want everyone to know that this isnt my usual reddit account, its a throwaway, as my friends know my other account and I wouldnt want them to see this post. But I would have no problem verifying my usual reddit account with any potential pizza givers. I also have a verification number from the RAOP website.

Anyway, I just woke up. Its 4 am in Ontario, and I dont think many pizza places are open until around 11 am. Me and my two siblings dont really have much here to eat. Im 22 by the way. My siblings are 18 and 17.

And I have about 14 dollars cash, I was just going to buy a some pasta, hamburger, some cans of soup, and a couple boxes of kraft dinner for the weekend. But it'd be nice to have a pizza to eat around lunch today.

Im not sure if I should be posting this now, or later when its a more appropriate time.

Anyway thanks again.
