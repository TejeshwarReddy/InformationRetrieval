My 17yo son has 4 friends over (since last night), and the wife, trying to keep the costs of feeding this many noisy LAN gamers/Magic players under control, builds a monster meat loaf in our 11x17 Pyrex pan for our Sunday meal.

Cold meat, cold pan, cold oven - safe right?  She assembles the load, puts it into the oven at 325.

10 minutes later, we hear a muffled wet crack in the kitchen - and she finds that we now have a hot mega-mess in our oven.

No way to filter glass out - shattering pyrex could launch chips into the meat - and no way to use the oven until all the chips and fragments and gibs are collected off the bottom - ugh...

I'm starting to think these Pyrex pans shouldn't be trusted once they pass 8 years old!
