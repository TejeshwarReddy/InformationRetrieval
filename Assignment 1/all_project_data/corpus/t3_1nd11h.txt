I'm overdrawn 18$ so I'm going to pawn some things tomorrow so I can get out of that hole (expensive fees, ya know?) and I get paid on the first, and I plan to pay it forward, but until then it'd be awesome if someone could help me out on something to eat! Rice and peanut butter is getting very old.

Just look at that [smile](http://imgur.com/D5wIpKC) just thinking of getting a hot cheesy pizza! :)
