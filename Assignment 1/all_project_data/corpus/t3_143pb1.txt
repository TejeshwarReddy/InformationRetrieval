In a moment of thoughtlessness, I completely neglected to add in the baking powder- that thing was as hard as a rock. Instead, I left it at home, and we drove to his friend's dorm about an hour away, and after a night of their LoL playing and my Redditing (pretty hard work, right?), we're starved. We'd really appreciate a pizza after a place opens up; I think the earliest is Papa Johns at 9 am. 

Also, I'll be repaying the offer in the first week of January when my university refund comes in. :D
