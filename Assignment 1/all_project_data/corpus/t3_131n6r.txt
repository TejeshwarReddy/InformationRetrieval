Alright, guys. I just got stood up by the same girl for the second night in a row. I have canceled my plans for the night so I could chill with her. She has decided both nights to not bail on me until it is too late in the night to make other plans. And to make it worse, my Netflix stopped working. I'd do anything (within reason) for someone willing to bro out for this.
