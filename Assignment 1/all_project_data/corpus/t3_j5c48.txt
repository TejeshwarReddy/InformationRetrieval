Eight Hour shift ends tonight at nine. I have a midterm tomorrow and another eight hour shift after. No food in the house. Any time or money I can save would be great. Not the best sob story but worth a try. Thanks

Edit : Leaving work at nine to take a hr bus ride/walk home. Info about me - Student working at my Univ's library. Pay is ok but the shitty thing is that I get a check once a month. Pay day is not til August 8 and the money I have saved is for rent/groceries. Can't afford eating out and  all the stores (that have food) will be closed by the time I get home. ( I live in the "cuts" (working class, , lower economic ladder neighborhood; suburban "firstworldproblem" type people might call it a "ghetto" or a "hood" but to me it's great place with cheap rent with great neighbors but a poor ratio of liquor stores to supermarkets or corner stores will actual food) 

EDIT : Thanks to everyone who upvoted this. I have received information regarding an ecard to use to get pizza. THANK YOU REDDIT FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN!
