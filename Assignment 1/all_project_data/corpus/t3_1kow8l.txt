Like I said, he has been working towards this for quite awhile now, and after getting through by the skin of his teeth he is now a teacher in southern ontario. He has been working at the honda plant for quite a while but he couldn't quit because we always needed the money to get by. Now I'm moved away and wanted to congratulate him with his favorite food... pizza! :)
