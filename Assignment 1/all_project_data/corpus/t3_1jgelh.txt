I've been unemployed for a while now, and while I've been job-searching, my roommates have been awesome. They've yet to charge me rent, and have given me food, beer, and most importantly, support. 
I really love these guys and I'd like to do something nice for them. I usually keep the house pretty clean, doing dishes, taking out the trash, and anything else my broke ass can do to show appreciation.

I know it's a long shot, but I thought I'd try RAoP. It would be really awesome if they could come home from work to a couple of pizzas. I don't know if it's in bad taste to ask for more than one, but we're three guys and one would just not be enough.

Thanks,

Robotbeard
