So, last summer I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease.  It's an autoimmune disorder where the body freaks out over gluten, a protein in wheat, barley and rye (And most processed foods, due to cross-contamination in factories).

Since then, I haven't been able to eat most breads, nor gluten-free foods processed in facilities where they might have gotten contaminated by something that contains gluten.  Obviously, this means pizza's out.

When I first was diagnosed, I tried to eat gluten-free pizzas - they were all absolutely terrible, and I just gave up.

I'm appealing to you guys, now.  **Pizza used to be my favorite food, and now I can't eat it.**  I live in Brooklyn, NY.  If anyone knows of a place in the borough that does decent, gluten-free pizza **that is also prepared in a celiac-friendly kitchen** (this is very important, just being made with gluten-free ingredients isn't enough), please let me know.  You don't even need to buy me any, just tell me that it exists and I'll go there myself first thing tomorrow.

Thanks for your time, redditors.  Have a slice and think of me!
