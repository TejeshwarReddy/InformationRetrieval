Moved back in with my parents while in college. We don't get along well at all and so I'm trying to move back out. Finals are this week and I've been looking for a job the past few weeks. I had a few real close calls but still nothing. I'd love to work in an office as an admin assitant, but I love cooking pizza almost as much as I love eating it, and I'll take something over nothing. Also my parents and I don't talk much so I'd rather eat spanish rice all day then ask them for food.
