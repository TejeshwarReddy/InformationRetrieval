I feel weird asking, but my family would really enjoy a pizza. My parents lost their jobs after the devastating tornado here in Joplin. We currently have other family members living with us that lost everything. We have 12 people living here right now and were living off can goods and pasta or whatever is given to us. We would grately appriciate a special gift like this..

&lt;3 God bless Joplin &lt;3
