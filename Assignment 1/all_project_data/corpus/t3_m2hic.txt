Had a bit of a talk with a close friend of mine last night about the environment of my group of friends post-breakup a few months ago.  Someone in the group had apparently continued to obviously flirt with my ex (who I'm now cool with) in spite of others warning him about my feelings on the matter.  I don't acknowledge his presence anymore and overall I'm over the breakup, but it still hurt to be reminded of that moment.  

It would be nice to know that there aren't inconsiderate people out there.  I'm at home today, resting and trying to get my mind off of things.  Some pizza would be nice...
