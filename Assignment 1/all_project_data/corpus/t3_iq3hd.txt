EDIT: Thanks to the kindness of an anonymous redditor, I can wallow in my breakup pain while stuffing my face with pizza. Thank you again, good Samaritan. 



In summer classes. Life is pretty shitty at the moment. Waiting on my $100 paycheck that got delayed until next Friday. I guess I should have been smarter about saving my money, but I just got out of a long distance relationship that I pretty much threw all my money into. Almost 5 years, and she just left recently, along with all the time and money I spent on her. I just want to eat and stop living off ramen. I don't really want sympathy about the breakup, I guess all the money and time spent was justified in some way, I just want to get over this with the best comfort food I know... pizza.
