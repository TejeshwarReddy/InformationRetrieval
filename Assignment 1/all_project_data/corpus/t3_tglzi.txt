Hey guys,
2 stressed out students need your help! Starting final exams tomorrow and the revision isn't going well! One of us is reading Ulysses all tonight and the other is trying to learn statutes and cases off! Very stressed out and panicked over these exams! Will be pulling an all-nighter for tomorrow so would appreciate a pizza to save us cooking time! We will return the favour once exams end and we can earn money again! 
Thanks :)
