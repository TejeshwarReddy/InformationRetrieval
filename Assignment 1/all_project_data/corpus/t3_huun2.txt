It's our last week of school and we wanted to celebrate somehow.  I suggested we all pool out money together and throw a pizza party.   So we did and turned it over to our SGR (Student Government Rep) who then had to get approval from the deacon.  But before he could somebody stole the money out of our SGR's room.  And now everybody is pissed and accusing the SGR of stealing our money which I don't think he did and everything is total shit.  I feel bad because it was my idea and because I've been defending the SGR they think I'm in on it too.  
  
I know this is a big unlikely request.  But if someone or a group of someones could make it happen like magic you wouldn't just be feeding a bunch of hungry kids you'd be saving a lot of friendships.
