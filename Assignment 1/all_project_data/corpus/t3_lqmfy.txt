Hey guys - my stomach has been meat/fish/animal free for 6 months. I used to crush pepperoni pizza like it was nothing. Ever since I've been doing the vegetarian thing, I haven't had any sort of pizza whatsoever.

So I'm asking if anyone can hook me up with a delicious vegetarian friendly pizza. I'd be forever grateful. (LA, West Hollywood)
