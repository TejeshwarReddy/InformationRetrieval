Helloooo, I just got my wisdom teeth taken out on Monday and they were killing me for about two weeks prior to that. All of that equates to me not having eaten anything other than soup for almost three weeks :( I am finally feeling better and really want to eat something real, but being that I'm a bartender and haven't been able to work for over a week, I haven't made any tips that can help me with said food. To add to that, I would love to share requested pizza with my boyfriend, since he's had to deal with my drugged up whiny ass for a week, and it'd be a nice treat for him. If anyone's willing to help, we'd love to pay it forward within the next few weeks.. Thanks so much!
