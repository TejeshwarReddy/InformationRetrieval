Just spent nearly the last of my money repairing nerve and tendon damage at Cedars on my hand. Had a great friend drop me off at home, but have and empty fridge, and can't really travel anywhere due to drugs still affecting me.

Randomly remembered this subreddit in a post surgery haze, and thought I'd plead to the reddit Gods. 

Will answer any, and all questions if there is any doubt. 

Sorry if this is the wrong format for this subreddit as well. I'm doing my best here! 

Thanks everyone.
