1. I might get evicted because my place of employment cut back on my hours. 

2. I found out that there is a good chance that I'm not going to celebrate Christmas with my family this year (after not celebrating Thanksgiving with them as well)

3. I'm super broke

4. I made a fool out of myself trying to impress a girl I really like.

Pizza sure does sound nice for lunch.....please help a guy out....:(
