I'm in a transitional phase where I'm looking for my first job and I can't spare any money to feed myself because all my savings need to go to my portion of the rent. My room mates are refusing to share any of the food they can easily afford with me and I'm very uncomfortably hungry. I'm not sure how this works but a friend suggested I try it and I'm offering whatever I can in way of art in return for being able to afford lunch today. I can draw animals and stuff.

Please and Thank you. Your consideration means a ton to me.
