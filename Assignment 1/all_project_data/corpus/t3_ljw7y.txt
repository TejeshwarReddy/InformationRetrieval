I am a moneyless musician in the Southeastern Michigan area. I'm in college and I just had to pay a LOT of bills. I now have but a few cents to my name! 

I will write and record you a song for some RAOP loving. If multiple people offer, I will do my best to write and record songs for each of them (hell, leftovers can feed me for days).

Bring on the requests!
