I have been looking for a job for about 3 months now and FINALLY! got the tap from the local UPS depot for a drivers job! Not the most glamorous job i know but hey for this area the money is decent and the station is close to home so no complaints from me! Paying it forward it specifically implied upon first full paycheck.

 Also if i get the job i promise not to be one of those jerk delivery guys that punts your nice box of Newegg goodness to the front door of your place from out by the curb!  :D

Any fine human being out there feel inclined to send out a good luck pizza to a prospective package jockey?

Now that i think of it that didn't sound so good..
