Feeling pretty lonely &amp; depressed. Friday was payday and had to use my whole cheque towards bills. Just want a warm pizza to make me feel better about not being with my family on Thanksgiving. I figured this would be worth a try. Im a decent guy that usually cares for others &amp; does good deeds. Hoping for some karma here while I go through a rough time. Thanks.
