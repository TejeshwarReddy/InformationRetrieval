I don't really have a sob story or anything. I paid my rent last weekend and have $7 left - I'm normally more prepared money-wise for The Post-Rent Week (TM), but wasn't so lucky this time. I planned for this by stocking up on Ramen and canned soup, but I had food poisoning over the weekend so I'd really love a real meal instead that I can likely spread out over 2-3 days. Cleaning a friend's apartment tomorrow night for cash so that'll get me through the rest of the week for gas and stuff.

Basic info, if it matters (first time requesting): 23, non-student, work full-time, live alone w/ 3 cats, obsessed with Harry Potter and mancala.
