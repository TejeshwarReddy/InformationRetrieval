So, to keep the sob story short, my paycheck has basically all gone to bills this past week and I won't be getting any money for another two weeks.  I have a box and a half of pasta and some sauce to last me until then, but a pizza would really help.  I know that since I just created a username today most people wouldn't be ready to offer their assistance and that's fine, I understand.  This is sort of a last resort for me anyway.
