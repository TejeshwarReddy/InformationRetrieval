The title pretty much says it all. I start working at my new job this upcoming week and am completely broke until then. My power has been cut off so I can't even cook things on a stovetop.

The neighbors in the apartment next to me have been kind enough to let me run an extension cable from one of their wall outlets near the door to a power strip in the living room so I can set up my computer (was putting in applications), lamp, and charge my phone.

Shit's rough and I'd just like a pizza or two I can live off of for a couple days or half week.
