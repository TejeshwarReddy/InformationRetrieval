Right around the new year, a friend and I both found ourselves unexpectedly and suddenly needing new places to live. Neither one of us was financially able to find a rental on no notice, so instead, we pooled our resources and moved into a seriously crappy hotel off the highway in a rotten part of town that had a weekly rate we could afford.

Fast forward 2 months and the hotel's being renovated by corporate and they've decided to boot everyone with one week's notice. We panic appropriately, pool our cash again, manage to just barely afford a room share that seems like it'll be awesome, but it leaves us flat broke (we have a cup full of pennies; that's it) till Monday. Weeks of ramen are doing us in, and a pizza... mmm... piiiiizza... would let us relax and maybe enjoy the evening instead of sniping at each other and feeling vaguely hungry. 

I'd be in a position to pay this forward on Monday--and would. Tonight is just all kinds of suckage.
