I'm using a throwaway account because I'm pretty embarrassed about asking reddit to buy me food, but I really have nowhere else to turn to. I live alone and I'm currently jobless. I once had a nice amount saved up in the bank, but unexpected expenses and bills have made it impossible for me to get through the rest of the month. The pantry is bare and so are my pockets. Literally. I ate my last Ramen packet a couple days ago and I just don't think I'm going to be able to make it until November. If there's anybody willing to help me out soon, I would appreciate it. I will return the favor as soon I am able to.

**EDIT 1:** I appreciate the input! Thank you for your advice, guys. As soon as I get the chance, I'm going to check out a food drive to get me through next week. I just gotta find a way to get through the next day or so!
