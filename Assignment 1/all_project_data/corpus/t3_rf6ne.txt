Hey everyone!
So I am in the band Sleep City and we have been recording our new cd for a little while now. Before I went into the studio I didn't have a job so I had very little money for food. Right now I have eaten Ramen for the past week and I've had enough! If anyone could send me a pizza I will be forever grateful. Too much ramen intake makes Kevin a dull boy.
