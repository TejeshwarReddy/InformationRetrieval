My bills this month stretched me a bit thin because I had to get some stuff on my car fixed up. My next payday isn't till Tuesday, so I have been getting really "Creative" with my basic ingredients I have left (corn and chicken broth macaroni noodle soup anyone?). I would love for someone to get me a Pizza. I'm not picky. Just something with Pepperoni. I will pay it all kinds of forward on Tuesday. And until then, I will write my champion a Poem dedicated to thier awesomeness.
