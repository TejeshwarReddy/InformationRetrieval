Hey all,


I'm afraid I don't really have a story.  My roommates and I take turns buying groceries for the week.  This week is their week, but they are out of town seeing family.  The kitchen is very empty.  Obviously, they'll make it up to me upon their return, but until that time I am on my own.


Unfortunately, I don't get paid from my regular job until Friday (and those of you who might recognize my username know I generate no income from my YouTube/Twitch channels), and the truth is I just can't afford to go grocery shopping until then.  I am almost positive I can make what I have left stretch to Friday, but if anyone is feeling generous I would be most appreciative for any assistance.


Looking back, I guess that kind of is a story.  Sorry about that.
