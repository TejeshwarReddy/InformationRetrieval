Hi there! My name is Jill, I'm a college junior living in Maine for the summer with my three sorority sisters. We are currently flat broke until payday on Saturday (well, Friday at midnight) and have a depressingly empty fridge to match our depressingly empty bank accounts. A night off from scrounging up what little is left of the food in our apartment would be nice! :)

We would really, really appreciate if someone could help us out in the pizza department. We have already decided to return the favor come the weekend. Thank you so much if you can throw us a bone (er, pizza) and we hope you all have a good evening!
