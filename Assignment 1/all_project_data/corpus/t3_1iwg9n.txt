If any of you have interned on the hill or in DC you understand how expensive everything is here...  you'll understand my plea. I've been limiting myself to one meal under $10 a day for the past month and just stumbled on this sub. I'm a long time reddit user and hate asking for help, but shit am I hungry.  My stomach is screaming at me just thinking about pizza right now.
