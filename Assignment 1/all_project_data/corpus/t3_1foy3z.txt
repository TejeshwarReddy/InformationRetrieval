I've been working since 5 without a meal since 9:30am and that entails being hung up on because I'm a college student trying to fill out surveys and that means I have to interrupt people at dinner time. If anyone wants to help me feed myself while I try not get too bothered by people hating me, I would love you forever and be permanently indebted.
