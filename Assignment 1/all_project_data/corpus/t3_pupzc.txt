EDIT:  A redidt-donor who wishes to not be named had helped me greatly with more than a pizza!  Thanks so much!

I recently suffered a lower back injury putting me out of work until I recover completely and I am waiting on my next cheque from the workers compensation board and trying to make my current grocery situation (instant noodles and chicken noodle soup) last as long as I can.

A small break from noodles for a night would be greatly appreciated.
