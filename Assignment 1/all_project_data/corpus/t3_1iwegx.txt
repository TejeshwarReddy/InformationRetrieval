I had heard it was coming down the pike, but my work cut my hours back because of the Affordable Care Act. I'm working 23 hours, part time per week. I get paid at the end of the week but I have some things I have to take care of, so I'll be hungry til next paycheck. Any help at all would get me through 3 or 4 days if I space it out. 

I literally haven't had a scrap of food since Sunday night. Also, I live just down the street from a Pizza Hut, so I can pick it up to avoid a delivery charge.

**EDIT** Begging
