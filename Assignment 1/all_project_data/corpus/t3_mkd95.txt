Hello Redditors, my roommates and I are broke literally until Thanksgiving. What little money we have is currently being pooled to get back home for Thanksgiving break and see our families and such. Something we don't really get to do often. A little bit about us? I am a musician/student studying Telecom. My roommate is also studying Telecom/intern at local, and our third roommate is simply put a true American. Help us advance our studies by filling our stomachs! 
Also by studying I may or may not mean playing Skyrim all day.
Oh yeah we reside Bloomington,IN aka IU
EDIT: still playing Skyrim still hungry. I need my daily vegetable intake.
