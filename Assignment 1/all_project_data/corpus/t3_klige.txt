Okay, so I'm not exactly in the worst place seeing as I am living with my parents. But, due to circumstances with them, we've been in really tight money for about three years now. And we've been getting by food wise on food banks, and some meat (mostly chicken) on payday. It's looking up recently, but that doesn't change the fact that I haven't had any sort of pizza in a little over three years. So, it'd great to get some from one of you guys. Verification can be given when it's set up.
