Inbetween jobs and havent gotten my first paycheck for my new place, so im living off 3 dollars till next friday. All my money has gone to my bus fair since i take 6 buses a day to get to &amp; from work.

Living in MN and i believe everyone delivers to me, with alot of coupons.

EDIT: Pizza'd thank you /u/sevenzig !
