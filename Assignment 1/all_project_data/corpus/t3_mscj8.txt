I'm new to Reddit, but I love all the different things that go on here. I am requesting just a small or whatever is cheapest pepperoni, and I will send you one back in return tomorrow. I'm not exactly sure how this all works, I've read the sidebar but let me know what else I need to do.

And also, if this does go how I'm thinking, I will certainly become a regular contributor.
