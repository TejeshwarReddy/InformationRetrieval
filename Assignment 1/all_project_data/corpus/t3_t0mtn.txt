Hello everyone (anyone?), how are you guys?  I've never posted on here but I could really use some help.  I have basically no money right now thanks to rent being awful, but I will tomorrow thanks to pay day!  Honestly, I would have no problem just being kind of hungry today but I have to study for a midterm all day/night and my hunger is becoming very distracting :\  

Blah, I hate posting an annoyingly self pitying story like that but that's my situation and I could really use some help.  I was really hesitant to post this, because as a lurker I have no karma.  I only really upvote/downvote so if you want confirmation that I'm a hardcore reddit addict I can send you a screenshot of the liked tab on my profile!  

Well, that's that!  So thanks for helping, thanks for reading, thanks for being cool :P

edit: and oh god to explain my username, its an inside joke as that was my first AOL screenname!
