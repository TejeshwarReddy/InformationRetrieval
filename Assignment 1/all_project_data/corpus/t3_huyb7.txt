Just found out I got a job I just interviewed for but I don't get paid for another 2 weeks. My wife and I have been on brown rice and dry cereal for a while now. Anyone willing to get us a medium or large pepperoni pizza would be appreciated. Once I get my first check I will kindly repay the favor.


Edit: Pizza already received and currently being enjoyed. Many thanks godbless this fucking site. I love you guys.
