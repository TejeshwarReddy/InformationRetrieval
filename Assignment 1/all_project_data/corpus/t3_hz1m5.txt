My boyfriend, Kyle, is a very sweet guy. He recently moved in with some relatives (so he could be closer to me!), but they are having financial troubles, and in consequence do not have any food in their fridge, or cabinets. They usually are gone, and he feels bad asking for money/food.  I am a poor college student, and barely am able to afford my living expenses. But right now he is looking for a job (very diligently), and hasn't found one yet. He tells me every night that its "okay" 'cause he's living closer to me now, or that "I could stand to lose a few pounds". But this just makes me sad.
He lives in Bellingham, Washington. If you are able/willing enough, post here/message me.
It would make his (and my) day...maybe our week?
If I can do anything in return, let me know.
