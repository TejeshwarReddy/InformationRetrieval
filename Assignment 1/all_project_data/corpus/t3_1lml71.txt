So I am currently home alone, having a miniature break down about the fact that I have no real friends anymore and that I might or might not be a complete waste of space. Pizza in my opinion is the ultimate comfort food. My day, well my whole summer, has been pretty bad. I've pretty much been black listed from my home town and I feel more alone and worthless than I have in a really long time. A pizza would definitely cure me of my constant sobbing that's been happening all day. So if anyone is feeling like cheering up a sad nobody in Colorado, I would be sooooo happy.....
