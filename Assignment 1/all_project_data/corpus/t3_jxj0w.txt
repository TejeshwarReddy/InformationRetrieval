I'm a pizza guy (I know, the irony..) and while I was at work last week someone pulled out in front of me and I t-boned them. We were both ok, but a few days later I found out she doesn't have insurance (She gave the officer a expired or fake card) and is apparently off the grid. Long story short, I haven't been able to work all week and I won't be getting any form of money until sometime next week. 

I can give proof of my situation if wanted, but I don't want to post the accident report for all to see.
