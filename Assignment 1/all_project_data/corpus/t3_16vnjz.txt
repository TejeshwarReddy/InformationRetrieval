I'm working on a movie with my school and our director is calling us names, telling me that I'm doing everything wrong and she also lost all of our audio. We lost about a day of filming. She has made this week a living hell, and I have to go film on Sunday and Monday (my days off from school). A pizza would be a real treat. Thanks.
