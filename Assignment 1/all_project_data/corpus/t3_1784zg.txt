I'm starting a new job Sunday, don't have any money, and my internet and cellphone will probably be cut off within a week.  I'm going to school so I'll be getting my loan money within the month, but for now I'm cranky and hungry.

I'm an author, so I'll be willing to either pay you back by buying a pizza when my money comes in or including you as a cameo in my next book...  or even writing a short story based around any subject you'd like.  For an example of my writing: [My first published book!](http://www.amazon.com/Spliced-Bloodsoak-Chronicles-ebook/dp/B00795J83O/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359074784&amp;sr=8-17&amp;keywords=Spliced!)
