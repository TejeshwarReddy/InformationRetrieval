Before I give details, I want to apologize for my previous request. I'm desparate for pizza, and bored out of my mind, so I may have possibly made a bogus request looking for pity. Then a friend told me I was an idiot and I should be honest, so I deleted that and made this instead. (Bad first impression is bad. :/ )


So I'm off tomorrow, and the 'rents don't get paid for another week, so we have gatorade, brocolli, and ramen for food, and I'm in a desparate mood for a pizza right now. I'll eat anything, really, so don't worry about giving me the wrong type or size; I'll eat it. I've got $1.90 to my name, so I can't afford water, much less a pizza. xD

In Missouri, USA. PM if you're willing to help a Reddit/Internet-addicted brother out.

And again, sorry 'bout the bogus request a bit back. When I crave, my stomach thinks for me.

Edit;
I managed to get a friend to hook me up with something, but thanks anyways guys (not to whoever downvoted me. Thanks fo nothing, &gt;.&gt;).
