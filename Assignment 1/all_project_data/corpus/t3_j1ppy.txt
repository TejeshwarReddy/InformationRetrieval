Hey! I'm a recent college grad in Seattle and I've been having a tough time trying to live on my own what with trying to find a job, pay rent and pay off loans simultaneously. I've really been craving pizza this week and it would be amazing to not have to eat ramen, rice or beans for a change. I can provide any verification needed and I hope to be on my feet soon to pay it forward.
