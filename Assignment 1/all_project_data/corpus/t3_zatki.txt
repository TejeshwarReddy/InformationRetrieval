Well, Hello RAOP! 

Not one to normally request things from others but I am desperately craving a pizza :/ All I have at my disposal is a shrimp alfredo lean cuisine (ack?). Bank is actually at a negative balance thanks to the fees that are imposed monthly.. sigh... lol... A pizzahut Pizza would really be appreciated! 

Thanks Reddit!

will pm verification to offer-er if they want it!

EDIT: Success! Finally managed to hunt down a hidden stash of cash, thanks **benkeiofthehillpeopl** for the offer!
