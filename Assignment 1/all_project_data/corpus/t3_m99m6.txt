I am Yet Another Poor College Student attending school in Portland, OR and times are tough.  I have had rice and potatoes almost every night for the past week and I would kill for some variety (and some scurvy prevention). I just got hired for a new job today, but I don't begin until the next semester in January, which is kind of a long time.

I mostly stay in lurk mode on reddit but if I get a pizza I solemnly swear to pop back in here when I have spare cash and pay it forward to some people.

In conclusion, http://i.imgur.com/KSzts.jpg
