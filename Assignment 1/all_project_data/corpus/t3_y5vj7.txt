Hey RAOPers!

Yesterday was my undergraduate graduation where I earned my BS in Chemical Engineering and I am looking to celebrate with some pizza goodness.  I'm still looking for a job but as soon as I find one I am planning on paying it forward and purchasing a piled high pizza for a person in need (alliteration intended).

Thanks so much!

EDIT: /u/kgros004 was kind enough to offer me a pizza for this Thursday and I should be able to hold off my pizza cravings until then.  Thanks!
