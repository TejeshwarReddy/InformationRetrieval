My SO is 32, has multiple sclerosis and is on disability. He went out of state to get a controversial surgery that's suppose to help his symptoms. It was paid all out of pocket by him and his parents. He's going to be home in a couple hours and I'd love to surprise him with pizza since he has been through so much stress these past few days. (And we are broke until the 1st) I can at the very least prove the MS/on disability parts if you would like. This would mean so much! Thanks in advance!

*Edit for spelling.
