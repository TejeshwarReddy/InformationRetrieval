hi! my partner and I have a been traveling and living on the streets for the past couple of years. We recently decided to settle down and change our pace a little bit. We've been here for a month and already have a place to stay and I start working a job I think I'm going to absolutely enjoy tomorrow. So everything is going great and I wish the world a kitten filled glory hole tastic day! We're just bummed we have to celebrate my last day of unemployment eating peanut butter toast and I promise to return the favor as soon as I get paid. Thanks!
