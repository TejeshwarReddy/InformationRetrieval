Money will be coming in Saturday from an old pair of speakers I'm selling, until then its pasta for me. Would really appreciate a pizza to help me through this week as I've got so much work and I'm exhausted from my public services fitness training. I finally got my financial support from college verified but that only means free lunch at college which I couldn't get until tomorrow. I'm finally getting an interview on Friday for a job which is really good as I've been unemployed so long and maybe this is the crutch I need to get through these financial issues I've been having for so long. Who knows, maybe one day I'll be gifting the pizza! But until then, I'm stuck. Would try and repay the favour if I could in some way.
