Hey y'all. First post so hoping for the best. Here's the rundown...

I lost my job about a month and a half ago right before my SO's birthday. I was bummed but kind of expecting it (cutbacks and such) and was able to score a few temp jobs here and there to keep my bank account stable, and seeing as my SO still had a full time job, we weren't terribly worried about the situation as a whole. 

Fast forward 2 weeks: my SO gets fired out of the blue by the new GM at the newsroom where he worked. He's been really down and has not yet been able to find a job. We had just signed our new lease so all of our money had gone to that and our bills. There is not much I can do for him at this point, seeing as I've only been working 2 or 3 days a week tops. 

Normally to cheer ourselves up we go all out on cheap pizza (Dominos, Hungry Howies, etc.), but with our lack of incoming funds, it's something that we haven't been able to do, and I think it would definitely lift his spirit a bit. If any of you wonderful redditors could help, I would be super appreciative. I don't have much of anything to barter with, but I am willing to send you a few pieces of record art that I have made if you would like something in return. 

I know this whole thing probably sounds silly, but I need help getting him out of this funk and figure this is a great way to do it. Thanks for any help.
