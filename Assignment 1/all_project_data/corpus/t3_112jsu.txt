Im a father of one son and I have a fiance, both living with me. Times have been so rough the past couple of months financially. I was collecting unemployment while i was actively searching for a new job and luckily was blessed last week with finding one. I just started work but unfortunately my unemployment didnt go on this month and I wont get a paycheck for a couple more weeks as they hold back for a week and pay bi-weekly. we are desperate for food, even tried going to a food bank but they they arent open til wednesday and we have nothing for me or my fiance or son to eat til then. I hate asking for assistance from others but Ive never been in this bind before and I'm really hoping someone out there could bless us with a pizza for dinner. It would be amazing, and I would be more than happy to pay it forward with my first check to another needy family facing the same difficulties as we are at the moment. Thank you all for reading my long post and bless you  .... We are located in KY btw
