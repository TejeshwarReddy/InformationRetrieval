My summer job at a college orientation didn't pay me in time to pay most of my bills, and I'm actually still waiting to see that paycheck because when it finally got sent out it go sent to my grandparents' house two hours away. In the meantime, my roommates at my apartment are on a health kick and I haven't had red meat or anything greasy in weeks. Pizza would be a very, very welcome break from my circumstances right now!
