We had to eat some nasty church donuts yesterday but they werent giving any out today.

PM me for details

Edit: maybe i should have mentioned before that my electricity is off and that im not just asking because i happen to be hungry. If you want proof that we dont have food i can upload pictures. And i can even show you the extension cord running from our neighbors house over here.
