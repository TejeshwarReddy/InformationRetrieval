I was laid off 2 months ago and due to bureaucratic bullshit I still haven't received any employment insurance. Damn, maybe I wont get any! Today I realized that after my rent is paid, I only have 9 bucks left... 

I don't really worry about food because I have a lot of rice and beans. But I'm getting really tired of rice and beans, rice pudding, fried rice, bean stew and etc. I crave for a pizza! But, I don't like asking for help. So if i get a pizza, I promise it's going to be a "today you, tomorrow me" thing. As soon as I get a new job or my EI, I will give back a pizza to someone on this sub!

Thanks in advance!
