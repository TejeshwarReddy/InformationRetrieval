So i woke up this morning to an Email saying that my Netflix account (Which I was under the impression was cancelled) charged to my bank account which only had $0.45 in it at the time. 

Tried calling the bank to settle this matter, but according to them since I had them help me with this before (one that happened because THEY charged me monthly maintenance fees that had never happened before) I was not eligible for them to waive my overdraft fee of $30. So now my account is -$40.16. Luckily I convinced them to stop, and my parents were nice enough to cover the fees for now.

tl;dr- my day has been a non stop shit show, and a pizza would bring tears of joy to my eyes. I will supply pics of tears of joy if needed.
