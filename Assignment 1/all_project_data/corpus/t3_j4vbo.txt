Well I thought I had it all straightened out with student loans, rent, cable, electricity, phone, etc. but my car decided it didn't want to play ball and so I'm a bit short on cash for the next two weeks.  I'd truly appreciate a random act of delicious pizza.

P.S. first time on this subreddit and I'm blown away by the community.  No other site is quite like this.  I have Facebook "friends" who probably wouldn't buy me a slice of pizza and here you guys are, strangers buying each other whole pies. Incredible.

**EDIT:** I was hooked up by a non-RAOP source, but I appreciate what you guys do here.
