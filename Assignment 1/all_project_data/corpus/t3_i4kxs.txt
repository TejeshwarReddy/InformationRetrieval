A friend of mine told me about this subreddit.  Maybe you guys could help me out.

I get by paycheck to paycheck, but I do alright for myself.  I, however, don't get paid until Thursday and I am not too proud to say I could use a pizza to munch on for the next couple of days until I can get to the store.

I have about $10 in my account, so I can get some food, but I also need gas and it's hard realizing that the gas is actually more important than food right now.

I'm in Alabama, if that helps at all.

Edit: Wow... thank you bakersdozen13.  I honestly didn't know what I was expecting, but this immediately fixed my problem for the next couple of days.  I'll be back in here after payday to pay it forward! ^_^

Edit 2:  Just picked everything up... Holy friggin god!  Above and beyond, good ma'am!  I will be back come payday to pay it forward!
