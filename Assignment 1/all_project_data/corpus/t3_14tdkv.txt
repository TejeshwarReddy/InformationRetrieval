I can totally give proof of the broken hand! Was looking for a job when I broke my hand in October and haven't been able to work since. Currently have a plate in my hand, can't work, and medical bills are piling up. And to top it all off, I'm starving! Never tried this before and just seeing if someone cares to give a pie!
