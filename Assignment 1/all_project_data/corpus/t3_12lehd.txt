Good evening RAOP sub reddit. I have been working all month living in Chicago and was able to just scrape by to pay rent for my fiance and her 12 year old daughter today. 

They have just recently come back from Des Moines Iowa after their Mom/Grandmother passed in an extended stay at hospice.

We're about another 10 days out from more food stamp credit on our Chicago Link card. 

A friend pointed out this sub reddit as we've only been eating plain pasta noodles all week. 

Other then a copy of Final Fantasy XIII I'd found a couple months ago for her (she's a huge fan), we haven't been able to give her daughter a proper birthday yet. 

If there is a kind soul out there who'd be kind enough to forward us some pizza, this small Chicago family would be most appreciative.
