Hello,

My name is John. I recently saw a news article from a friend about this site and thought that it was a really nice idea. I live in Chadbourn, NC and this Thursday it will be my 5 year-old's birthday and as much as I hate to tell him due to some unexpected situations I will be unable to give him anything for his birthday until next week on Friday. I was kind of hoping that a pizza would cheer him up at least. I'm not real sure how this works but I would be willing if helped, to return the favor next week when I get paid. 

Thank you so much, anything would be appreciated!
