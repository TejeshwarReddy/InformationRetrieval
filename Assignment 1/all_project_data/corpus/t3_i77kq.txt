Today is our 4th wedding anniversary! We don't get paid until next Friday and the money we had set aside for a nice dinner tonight begrudgingly went to various bills and gas in the last few days. She thought this subreddit was an awesome idea when I told her about it and I'd love to surprise her with pizza as opposed to the now planned spaghetti. We're in Florida, btw.

edit: [Pizza received!](http://i.imgur.com/5dcGb.jpg) My wife went from confused to angry to amazed hilariously fast. Thanks to MsFit for making our anniversary dinner delicious and awesome.
