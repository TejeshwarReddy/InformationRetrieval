I'm currently getting over being sick for the entire weekend. It doesn't help that I managed to completely screw myself over money-wise. (It's a long story of a 20 year old failing at personal finance) I'm currently spending a summer doing research at a university in Pittsburgh, but need enough money to drive back home in a week. This basically leaves me with a $0 food budget :(

If anyone is willing to help, once I get back on my feet (in 2 weeks I'll be home and get another paycheck), I'll definitely pay it forward.
