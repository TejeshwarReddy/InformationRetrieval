Worked at a small software solutions company as a recruiter in HR. The company decided my position should have someone with more experience, and that meant I was no longer qualified for my job (was entry level, became 3+ yrs experience required). To make it worse, I was laid off 1 hour before the company handed out iPads to all the employees as a Christmas gift.
