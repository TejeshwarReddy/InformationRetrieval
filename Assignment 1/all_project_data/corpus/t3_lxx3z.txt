I was laid off a few weeks ago, but ndb as I found a new job. Neither paid a lot, but my savings was depleted over the last few weeks while working my new job. Now I am gainfully employed, but have no cash until I get paid on Friday. I could sure use some pizza love to fill my tummy until payday. 
Thanks for any help, fellow redditors. 

Edit: I got a pie! Thank you, paulinator!
