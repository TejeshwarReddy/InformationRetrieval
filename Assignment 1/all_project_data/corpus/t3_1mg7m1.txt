I'm currently unemployed trying to get another job, I have an interview on Monday. Out of money for Pizza luxuries and hungry :( - I don't have a cat..., but I could deliver a pic of some local wildlife? Squirrel? Crow?? Or perhaps a sweet new wallpaper for your desktop from my collection. Any help is much appreciated - Thanks for your time!
