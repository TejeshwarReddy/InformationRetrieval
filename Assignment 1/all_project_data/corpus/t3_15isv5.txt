I got a little over ambitious with my Christmas gift spending this year for my family and girlfriend and now I'm out of money until I get my paycheck tomorrow at my internship. I'm at work now and I would have to be here for 10 more hours without food unless I get help. I was hoping someone could help me out since I work right next to a Pizza Hut and could run over there to grab some lunch and dinner. Thanks for any help!
