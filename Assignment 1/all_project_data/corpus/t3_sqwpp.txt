I don't want to get into my whole sob story, let's just say times have been stressful and tough. Been having a hard time just keeping the utilities on.

I love the fact that food pantries exist, otherwise I'd have to be living off of government food programs, which I'd rather not use since there are much needier people, but after awhile canned foods and dried beans get really old really fast.

It would really make my month to have someone actually pay for a pizza for me. It seems unreal that someone would do this. Here's hoping.
