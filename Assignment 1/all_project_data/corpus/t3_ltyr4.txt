I wont see my first cheque for another month (I am low on funds in mye bank account) so my parents as nice as they are have footed my rent bill (1 month), I know i'll be running out of groceries soon. Pizza is my favorite food and It could easily push a few more days untill I need to start dipping into my near empty bank account for new groceries, which will def. be canned goods.
