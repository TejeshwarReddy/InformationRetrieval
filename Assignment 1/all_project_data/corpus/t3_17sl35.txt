Tonight's one of those nights where my boyfriend and I are in a mighty funk about our bank account balance. I'm offering some artwork [in exchange for cheesy delight](http://imgur.com/a/u5lWD#0). If there's one-- maybe two-- items you'd like, reply or PM me. I can also make you a similar commission item. I do most things, as you can see there...

[plus My Little Pony...if you happen to be into that kind of thing.](http://fillyphalanx.tumblr.com/)
