I do not have a sad story that I'd wish to share, as I feel that life is full of ups and downs. Because this is one of (if not) the busiest time of the year for retail, I've been working 9 and 10 hour days for about two weeks. I go to school at night and get just enough sleep to wash and repeat. I'm working on obtaining my degree in Business, and I hope that I'll be able to open my own shop someday. I have alot of big ideas I'd like to see play out in the long term business wise, but for now I feel pretty exhausted XD. No real need here, I make enough to get by but after a day of cyber Monday customers I don't have it in me to cook dinner. A ham and pineapple pizza would make my night. I hope someone can help me out, but if not thank you and hope you got in some of the cyber Monday deals.
