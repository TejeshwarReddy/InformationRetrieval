My mom recently had major back surgery for a car accident she had years ago, and was in recovery when she contracted MRSA (Blood infection immune to oral antibiotics) and she has to give herself antibiotics through an IV line with a syringe every day. She also has a home health care nurse come in every day and Pack her surgical wound and push out any infectious puss that might build up. It's a pretty painful process. Her injury in the accident came right after she got her Commercial Driver's License and was about to become a truck driver, now she can't work at all. We're extremely low on food until our food stamps come in. My mom's Doctor's our pressuring her to gain weight or they're going to put her in a nursing home. She only weighs 85 pounds, and it would be amazing if a friendly Redditor helped us out.
