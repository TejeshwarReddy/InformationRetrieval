I just got my wisdom teeth taken out, and thanks to the drugs, bleeding, and swollen cheeks, I pretty much can't do anything except stay inside or sleep. I can't even watch TV or be on the computer that much, because my head hurts if I stare at the screen too much. I'm constantly bombarded with pictures of good food (unhealthy food) on Facebook, Twitter, and of course Reddit, and I would love to have a pizza to celebrate my healing process (whenever that might be). I don't have a sob story to tell, but I'm low on cash and have to pay my credit card off soon anyways. Any sort of pizza flavored goodness would be appreciated. 

If you want, I could write you a poem, send you a photo of something (within reason, I'm not talking gonewild material here), record some guitar playing, or something like that. Just let me know, I'm not doing much with my time anyways.
