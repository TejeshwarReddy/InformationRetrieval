I'll save you all from a pity party, but right now I'm really unable to do most normal things thanks to medical issues.  I can even tell you about them if you PM me.  I don't need a pizza, but I do want one.  I have food in the house and I'm not going hungry, but pizza sounds great and because of medical issues I haven't been able to work recently (going back soon though!) and sometimes pizza is the greatest comfort of all.  I live in the midwest, if you PM I'll give you the exact location but as of right now it's not even noon so this is more of an asking in advance.  And like I said, this is a want and not a need so if someone here is way more needy then me, feel free to skip me.  Whatever happens to me, I will happily pay it forward when I can.  

Thank you.
