More information about my story/situation in my post history. Living in a car. Can't type too much-stealing wifi from outside a rowdy bar. 

Will update with happy pizza photos if donated! Will also love forever! 

No address technically, but I can give an address and wait outside. It's that worth it to me. 

Here's to pizza and awesome people! 


Edit: To top off the sob story, I have two interviews next week on Tuesday, one at the same time the food bank opens =(  

Edit2: I'll circle around the Internet area one more time tonight. Deliveries for probably 3 more hours. Tomorrow, the next day, or any day will be just as nice.


It will be about two weeks until I can buy my own deliciousnesses.
