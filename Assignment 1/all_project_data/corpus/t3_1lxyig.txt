Reddit please give me
A bit of your time,
I've smoked my last smoke
And spent my last dime

I'm hungry and sick of
My bowls of rice,
A pizza I think
Would be pretty nice

Though my wallet is empty
My heart is full,
For I met a hottie
In my social lull

I'm selling my Playstation
To take out this girl,
A sacrifice
That might make me hurl

Provide me a break
A bread cheese duet,
One night of pizza
I'll be forever in your debt
