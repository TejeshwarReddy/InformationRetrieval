Mass., US.  I'm flat out broke until tomorrow with no food in the house for dinner tonight.  My daughter is 2 and we usually do a pizza and movie night every once in a while, and she's been asking about it.  I've got rent and car payment coming up, and bill collectors calling.

I try to not let my wife know exactly how bad we are when it gets like this, but she mentioned we didn't have anything for dinner tonight, and I can't get groceries until tomorrow.  Can anyone help out?  Thanks a billion.
