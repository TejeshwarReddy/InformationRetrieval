College student, just got gainfully employed but don't start until a week from now and won't get paid until end of month. The other job I work has a check in the mail but it'll be close to a week until it gets here, clears the bank, and I can get some food in the apartment. I'm working from a 6 month budget that had a $2000 shortfall. Sad thing is that I'm already one pizza behind in paying it forward. I have a couple wrinkled potatoes, frozen potato stuff, frozen fish, a little frozen fruit, about 10 eggs, some rice, a little bit of frozen peas, one packet of kool-aid and some coffee, and a box of macaroni and I can't eat any more of that stuff without puking - I just can't force any more of it down my throat like I have been the past two weeks. I had my laundry money planned out for this month to the quarter only to find the landlord increased cost per load by 50% without telling anyone so I'm tapped out of cash. I have maybe 20 miles left in the tank to get back and forth to work and then to the bank to cash my paycheck (that's still in the mail and won't arrive until Monday or Tuesday depending on the whims of the mail service).

I know there are people in worse shape but if someone would be so kind as to send one my way? I know it's too late tonight but tomorrow, perhaps?
