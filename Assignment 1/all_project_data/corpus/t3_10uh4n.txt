I've been living on my friends couch while I try to find work. I hate mooching, which is what I've been doing for most of the past month. Tonight, my friend and his girl will be out for a while and I would love to have a nice pizza waiting for them when they get back as a thank you for all they have done for me. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
