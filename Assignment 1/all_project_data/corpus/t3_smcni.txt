I'm running out of money, so is my girlfriend, lots of stress over whether she'll be forced to drop out of college or not over parents unpaid taxes. Feels bad, man. I'm also running out of card swipes for dining hall food, and won't have enough to eat throughout finals. Pizza would be appreciated, and we'll send you an artsy photo of a building on campus. I also give the solemn promise to donate back to the community by buying someone pizza with my first summer paycheck.
EDIT: Feeling like an idiot: Greeley, Colorado.
