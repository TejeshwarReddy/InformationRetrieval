Hi guys.  I feel embarrassed, but I'd like to humbly request some pizza assistance. I have -180 in my account until Friday, and it's all my fault. I paid rent twice this month by dropping off a check and then setting up bill pay online. I must have selected the wrong date, as March's rent was paid twice. 

I've been fortunate to have friends who have chipped in with gas money or smoke for the last week, but my buddy's wife is probably wondering why I'm over so many nights for dinner.

One pizza would be dinner tonight, as well as lunch and dinner tomorrow until I wake up Friday to glorious pay day. I promise to pay this good deed forward, and I'm sorry again to be asking.
