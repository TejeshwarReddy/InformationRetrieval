Hi, family here in need of some extra assistance. Would greatly appreciate a hot meal for tonight and tomorrow.
I am a long time "reddit lurker" and I am aware of people being hesitant on here to give to the noobs.
I am hoping that someone helps us and the kids out though. I am aware of r/food pantry and will be asking for groceries but for tonight if anyone can help, we will appreciate it. Thanks!

p.s. sorry if this is too wordy
