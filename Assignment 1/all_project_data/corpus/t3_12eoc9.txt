I've noticed that the acceptable custom in RAOP appears to be to post your desire for pizza along with a compelling story of trial and hardship which validates your worthiness to receive said gift.

I don't have such grand aspirations.  My desires are pure, transparent, and fly in the face of this custom.  I want a pizza.  I want someone else to pay for it.

In some cosmic way, doe this warrant an x-post in r/firstworldanarchists?
