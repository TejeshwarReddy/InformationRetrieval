The current heat way somehow fried my car and i havent been able to go to work this week. Money is now at a minimum. The nearest restaurants/grocery stores are almost a mile away from my house. i was kinda hoping someone could send me a pizza. I get paid friday and can use that money to fix my car, and then pay the pizza forward.
Please help im a long time redditer that wants to remain anonymous.
