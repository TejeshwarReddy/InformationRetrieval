So turns out my gf has bronchitis and when she went in to work her boss made her leave in fear of "infecting the other employees." So now we're just hangin out at home, about to get down on some halo 4.

The only thing that could make this day more perfect, aside from her getting miraculously better, would be a nice tasty surprise from someone nice.

Will provide pics of us enjoying said pie, and if we can get a good shot of it, us beatin face.

Cheers!
