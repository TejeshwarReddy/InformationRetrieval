Hi everyone. I've just seen my account after paying rent and don't have enough to buy anything. I'm finally on track with rent and bills after struggling to make ends meet for a while, but this leaves me without food until the next paycheck. Could really go for some pizza! I appreciate everyone who reads this, thanks to all RAOP subscribers.
