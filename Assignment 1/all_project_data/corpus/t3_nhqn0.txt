Hi I know I am new here but I had to try and at least ask. I've been on reddit for only a couple days and I first asked on [/r/loans](/r/loans) for a small loan for gas money so I can start my new job but I am too new so there has been no offers. Well I think I lost my chance at this new job. I will find out tomarrow.  (I'm telling you all this so you know why I posted there for a loan and now here for pizza. We currently have $0.36 to our name. My husband asked for overtime at his job so he has to work 12 hrs tonight. I have no food to make him for lunch and he has to eat with working so many hours. If anyone can help I will pay back with interest plus I will buy another fellow member a pizza on 12/22(Thursday). I don't care about eating myself I just really would like to get my hubby something as starving and working a physically damanding job is torture. (he does metal finishing like chrome plating). So please if you can help me feed my hubby you would be my personal pizza angel:) I will be forever indebt to you!! If you can't I still would like to thank you for at least reading my post:)
