I'm fearful of being labeled a scammer or something after reading a lot of the other posts here, but I assure you this is genuine. My wife of 3 years left me and took our 11 month old daughter a few days ago. She didn't take too kindly to me finding out she was cheating on me. As bad as that is, she took our EBT card right before we were to go grocery shopping, leaving me heartbroken, alone, and without food with a week to go before my next paycheck. My stomach growling is honestly the least of my problems at this point, but I was told this would be a good place to try to get some dinner and solve at least one of my issues, or at least an open ear. I'm going to spend quite a bit of time on here today, as the sense of community throughout the entire site is quite impressive and will hopefully serve as a distraction to what I have going on. Thanks for reading, and I hope whatever deity you follow blesses you in every way possible.

Edit - Thanks to miafria! What a great community and people.
