I have never been so scared in my life. My daughter and I were walking home from the park, when a man approached us. He asked me if I could spare some change. We were near the vending machines, so I assumed that was what he needed the change for. After handing him the change, he reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a gun. He took my purse, my watch, my wedding band, and my daughters ipod. I am shaking as I type this because I can't believe that something like this could happen in this community. I am the type of person that would give the shirt off my back to someone if they needed it. Now, I'm without cash, my cards have been cancelled and I literally have nothing. 

The police said someone else was robbed a few days ago and think it may be the same person. I filed a police report and I hope the find the SOB. Pardon me, but it's the truth. If the man was in desperate need for help, I would have been willing to help him. He not only took from me, but he also took from my child and I was powerless to stop it from happening. 

I hope someone can buy a pizza for my daughter and I tonight. I realize it's late, but we just don't have enough food in the house to wait until Monday when my banking situation will be resolved. I can provide a copy of the police report and any other verification information you may need. Please, I am begging for help. We are in St. Louis.
