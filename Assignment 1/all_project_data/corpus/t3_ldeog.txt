So last night I lost my debit card, but I had to cancel it because what ever money I have is on that checking account.So with no money or access to money, until my bank opens, I couldn't even take the bus this morning. Luckily I had my bike so I could ride to my over-the-weekend tutoring job at my college...it took 2 hours. So yeah, I've been here on campus for a few hours now and I still have 4 more hours to go. I'm starving, I keep eating the free lollipops we hand out to students and drinking water to settle my stomach. If anyone out there would would help me I promise to return the favor. I work at Bellevue College, WA
