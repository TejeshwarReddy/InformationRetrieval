Hey Reddit,

So my co-worker has been engaged for a while and is moving out to Arizona so she and her fiance can be closer to her fiances daughter. Yesterday she, out of no-where, announces that she is going to get married THIS MORNING. No friends, no family...they just signed a paper at town hall and she even had to come into work after. 

My request? This girl is obsessed with Margarita Pizza and Pizza in general...she eats it everyday. She didn't come in with any today though. I'm guessing it's because she just got married with no party and miiiiiight be a little sad about it.

I don't know why they didn't have a ceremony as I'm afraid to bring it up.

Personally, I just started working here and haven't gotten my paycheck yet so I'm broke. Would anyone be able to order a large Margarita for this poor girl? 

This is my first post to this r/ so forgive me if I am breaking any rules. I can provide any verification you need but I want this to be a surprise for her!
