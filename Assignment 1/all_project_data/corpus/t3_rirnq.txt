Hi there, this is my first post on reddit, long time lurker, always checked out RaoP for some inspiration about good people doing good things. I'm not starving, I have some decent food in the fridge, but I would really love some pizza. Pizza is my #1 favorite food, and I usually order some as comfort food. I'm just completely out of money till next friday.

First, I get an email this morning from my step mom that our little dog has kidney disease which is why shes been sick a lot lately. Vet gave her a shot of something to see if she could keep food down, but it didn't work, so shes going to be put down. Then I get home today and boot up my new laptop, its wonderful I saved for 6 months to pay for it, I can play every game that's out on ultra settings and have great FPS. After about 20 mins of playing some Skyrim it just shuts off, won't turn on. Hours of tech support online/calling ASUS, I find i have to send it in for repairs/replacement and won't get it back for up to 2-3 weeks. On my old computer now reading reddit and feeling bad. Shitty day. So if anyone would like to send me a pick me up, I would love you forever.
