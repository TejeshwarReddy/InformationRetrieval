I'm not complaining, she's great and gets me eating really healthy. I'm pretty much vegan most of the time, at the very least vegetarian, though I eat seafood regularly and chicken or other meat on occasion. But right now, I'm broke and everything in the house is vegan.

I've made some badass vegan pizzas in the past but the cheese, although it melts, just isn't the same.

I'm working on a crossbow-wizard that imbues his spells in crossbow bolts to fire at enemies.

Also, I don't drive, but there's a Dominoes and a Papa Johns that deliver to my house.

There's also a local place but I dunno how RAOP could handle that.

If any verification is needed, I'll do whatever is needed. Check my posting history, you'll see everything I say is true.
