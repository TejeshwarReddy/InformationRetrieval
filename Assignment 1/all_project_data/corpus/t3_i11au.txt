hi, so i'm new at this, i was told by a friend that this site could help me, basically i'm a student in england, living with 3 other guys (well was suppose to be) we made the down payments all the pre-payed bills and what not then 1 guy pulls out this has made me and my friend very skint, as we're picking up his third of the payments and now i've heard my "friend" is thinking of pulling a fast one on me trying to get out of this contract as well! - so, here i am, a poor, frustrated student who has lost trust in his friends and is struggling to put food on the table, anyone going to help a brother out? 

i'm not begging, i'm new at this, reading some of the stuff on this page has given me some hope that their are more humans with hearts on this planet then i think.
