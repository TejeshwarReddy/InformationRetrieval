Hi, we're not broke but not living a kings life either, very far from it. we are just feeling a little lethargic today and having a pizza delivered would be amazing, but pay day isn't until friday. We would love to have a pizza and will pay it forward come the weekend when pay has been received. We may have some herb that is inducing such cravings and laziness at the same time as well, so this really would be awesome! Help a friend out ya kno
