I am a poor, hungry college student, but I have the skills to fix this! I am looking for something to eat tomorrow night (Friday, 9/21) and am willing to do engineering/math problems for food!

I am a fifth year Mechanical Engineering student, so I am fairly steeped in many areas of knowledge.

PS: If you want something else, like a funny picture of a pony, I would be happy to oblige. :)
