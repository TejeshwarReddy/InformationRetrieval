Hi everyone,
I'm mainly a lurker which explains my sparse comment history but have long been aware of this subreddit and think it's a great idea! Our situation is that we are two full-time students scraping by, we've not been able to find jobs so far this summer and are living on very little. It's been a difficult couple of months and some pizza would be a much appreciated treat and give us a bit of a boost. It goes without saying that we would be very grateful and will return the favour next month when our finances are in a healthier state.

Thanks so much to anyone who responds!
