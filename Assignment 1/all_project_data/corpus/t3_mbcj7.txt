my name is andrew kim
im a undergrad student at ucsd (structural engineering major) and ive been out of funds for the past week. i live on camino raposa and earlier this week i was on my way to vons to buy some groceries when a random guy came up to me in his infiniti and asked desperately that he needed gas to go to irvine. first thing i thought was to help him out cause it reminded me of the saying "today you, tommorow me". So i decided to lend him money for gas because the person seemed to be dressed properly, had a decent car, and didnt seem to be a scammer to me. he took me to the nearest atm and i thought he would just ask for 40 dollars for a full tank when he said that he would appreciate around 160 dollars which he could pay back this upcoming saturday. i had 100 dollars in my debit card...so i gave him 80. 20 for myself to buy some needed groceries. He then left repeatedly thanking me for my generosity and said that if i called him this saturday he would repay me the amount as well as a gift certificate at a restaurant that he works at. Now it is sunday, i called him around 10 times on saturday and has not picked up. At this point i am guessing that he isnt going to be paying me back and now i have no money for any kind of food and am very hungry atm. i cooked rice and ate it by itself because i didnt have anything to cook but i am still starving. i would appreciate any kind of kindness reddit
