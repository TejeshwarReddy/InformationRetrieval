I'll keep my sob story short.

I'm not poor, though my current circumstances might lead one to believe that to be the case. I'm in a rut financially, trying to dig myself out with a newly acquired job. This would be the happy ending to my story, if I could see my pay checks. Instead, for the time being, I'll be feeding my checks directly to my landlord. 

So I ask Reddit, with a humble heart and an empty stomach to help me out with a delicious pizza pie.
