I'm currently unemployed and a full time nursing student, going to school with my sister. We both come from a poor family, we have no help from our parents, but we try and support each other. We're running low on food and we could use a nice hot meal.  Just for full disclosure, my sister and I have received pizza from RAOP about 4 or 5 months ago. All we have in the house is rice and beans, so any pizza with a lot of veggies would be nice.

Thank you. 

Also, here is proof of my lack of money: http://i.imgur.com/yPF5KMX.png
