Look, we're not starving, but we all forgot/don't have our credit cards with us and could use a nice pie. Some help would be nice. Here's some bullshit reasons why we really deserve it though:

-We're in a band.

-We just watched The Big Lebowski.

-We have a dog named Cooper.


[Here's us three](http://i.imgur.com/qhdt2.jpg) looking super content with our middle-class living conditions (I'm the sorta black dude).

We probably aren't as qualified as other unfortunate subscribers here, though this IS *random* acts of pizza anyway! I also can't really promise this since I'm just another internet citizen, but if someone gives us pizza, I'll make sure to pay it forward soon when my new credit card comes in.

Even if we get nothing and are downvoted to hell, props to this wonderful community and like I said, I look forward to being a contribution some time soon.

Oh!, and here's Sergio [looking sexy as fuck](http://i.imgur.com/TaikH.jpg).
