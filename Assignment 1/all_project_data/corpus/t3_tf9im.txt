As the title says. Finished last of my exams not to long ago and finally found work.  I don't get my first pay until Friday and could use a pizza to make the hunger go away :]. 

Sorry for the throw away account. I can provide you with my actual account (Reditor for nearly two years, second time using this subreddit). My friends / siblings often stalk me on reddit and I don't want them to know im in a shitty financial situation for the time being and offering their help. 

Silly logic I know, won't ask family but will ask strangers on the internet for food :P.  My pride... its a very strange form of pride.
