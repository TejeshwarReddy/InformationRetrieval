Cliffs Notes to my current state of affairs: Squatting in a friends old apartment until the 17th (then onto legit homelessness), interviews almost every day but no job, I have no cash left and I am out of food, I feel terrible for posting this here and expect nothing to come of it, but I am seriously hungry and asking another of my friends for help is just an invitation to resentment in the future.

Is there anyone out there kind enough?
