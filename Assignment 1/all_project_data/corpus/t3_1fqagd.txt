So I just graduated 2 days ago, and I have paid rent, graduation fees and have even had to use every dime of my graduation money to get moved. Now I've come to the middle of the week, no money and extremely hungry. Help a guy out? Willing to offer graphic design/advertising consulting! Or a copy of Dota 2!
