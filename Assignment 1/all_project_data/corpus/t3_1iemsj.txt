Recently I have been given the opportunity to move schools, where I would be away from the people who would 'use' me (bully doesn't sound a justified word somehow) however the catch is that I would know absolutely nobody there, I will be practicing for my A-levels later this year and I feel a lot of pressure on me by my family and peers.
So my favorite foods is Italian (Pasta, Gnocchi, Pizza ect.) and it would be of a great service if I could get some comfort food or even some advice to help me be calm, I really don't know whether this decision will be good for me or not. Please help!
