I'm going in for orthoscopic surgery tomorrow; and just found out earlier today that I have to pay a $100 copay when I get to the office tomorrow morning, this $100 was intended for groceries. I'm only 20 years old, and due to my knee disability, my employer has cut my hours to where I can barely make ends meet anymore. One of the deacons at church suggested this website to me when I called hysterical this evening trying to figure out how I would feed my family for the rest of the week. I have paper work proving my need for surgery tomorrow, if requested. Thank you and God bless.
