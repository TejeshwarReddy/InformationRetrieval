It's rainy season here and Seattle, and I haven't yet mustered to courage to go outside. Let me (and the dog) stay inside, in my leotard (and in her bear outfit), and eat dinner! I will photograph and submit several images of myself eating said pizza while in a handstand and/or various acrobatic acts. All, of course, in the name of proper digestion.

Thank you!
