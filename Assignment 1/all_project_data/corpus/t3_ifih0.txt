Hi guys,
My name is Lani, I'm a teenage girl from LA. I currently go to summer school during the day but because of my families income, it's hard to pay for my school lunch everyday, leaving me hungry. I am fortunate to eat after school and sometimes before but other than that, I have no lunch. If anyone could provide a pizza for one day, I would truly be grateful. Thank you.
