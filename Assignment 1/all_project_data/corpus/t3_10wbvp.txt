Sick in bed with what I think might be acute bronchitis (can't get in to see the doctor until tomorrow, so I don't really know). Whatever I have isn't the kind of thing that affects your appetite, because I am absolutely starving, and I really don't feel up to cooking actual food in the actual kitchen. I would just about die of happiness if I had a nice hot, comforting pizza and something cold and fizzy to drink right now, and if anybody is willing to hook me up, I will happily pay it forward as soon as I can! :)

ETA: I'm in Texas, USA, btw.
