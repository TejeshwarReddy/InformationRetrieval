Kicked out of my parent's house 3 years ago, living on my own.
I've had to drop out of school this semester because I don't have anyone to cosign a loan for me, and I can't earn enough to pay for college.
My job was far, and I had to wake up at 5am. I crashed my car falling asleep at the wheel three weeks ago. I lost my job because I couldn't come in the next day.
Because I lost my job, I can't pay rent next month, and I don't know where I'll be.
And today, I saw $5 in my bank account, and used $3 on fuel to make sure I don't run out of gas in the middle of the road.
Sure I'm upset, but none of those things got to me. You know what did? 5 minutes ago I opened my fridge to see that all I have left is some mixed vegetables, and a slice of white bread.

There isn't much more to feel. Just defeat, I guess.
