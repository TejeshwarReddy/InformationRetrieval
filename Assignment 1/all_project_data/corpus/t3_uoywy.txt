I'm at the library right (sigh) now and probably will be all night until my final at 8:45am tomorrow. I barely have money to buy food from my college, but a pizza would go a long way in helping me concentrate for this final. I will pay it back once I have get money it to my account. 

Edit: Just looked at my title *nods in shame*
