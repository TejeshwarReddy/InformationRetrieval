Hey. I'm an acting student in North Vancouver. I've been waiting for my student loans to come in all semester, but alas, they still have not. I've had to borrow money from friends and my girlfriend to make it by so far, but I'm feeling really shitty about having to do it all the time. I've basically run out of food again, and I'm loathing having to ask borrow more money right now. If someone is willing to hook a student up with a pizza, when my loans come in I would love to pay it back and gift someone else a pizza. In the meantime, I could provide a monologue of your choosing!
