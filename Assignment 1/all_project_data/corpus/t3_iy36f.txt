While looking for a new apartment downtown I somehow lost my wallet.. I feel pathetic for asking because I'm far from a leech, but I'm hungry and out of luck on food.  I ddnt think I could feel so helpless without a banking card..

There are others out there that need pizza too.. But I will pay it forward if someone will make my night tonight... :/

Edit:  forgot to say I live in the northern KY area.  I will also share my REAL reedit username through pm after transaction goes through.. I'm just way embarrassed.
