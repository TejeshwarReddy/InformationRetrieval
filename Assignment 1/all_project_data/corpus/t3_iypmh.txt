I am currently at work, surrounded by people who make more than I do for doing less work.  My job stresses me out so much and 95% of my money goes towards bills/paying for daycare for my baby girl.  To top it off, my work just switched to bi-weekly pay and I literally have $12.32 in my checking account to last me until Friday.  Due to lack of finances, my boyfriend and I have not been out to eat/gotten take out in almost a year and would love a meal that I don't have to cook.  I'll pay it forward as soon as I have a little extra cash... promise!
