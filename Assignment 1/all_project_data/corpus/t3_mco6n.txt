Hi, RAOP. Just as the title says. I'm an unemployed college student and I've been avoiding meals where I can because I can't afford to go out (even to Mickey D's) and we don't even have fruit, vegetables, or snack foods. Little sister is kinda fat and eats everything that doesn't make me gag. Is anyone feeling charitable?
