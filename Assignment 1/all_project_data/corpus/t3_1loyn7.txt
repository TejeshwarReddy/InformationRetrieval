Due to some other expenses we are unfortunately a bit tight on funds!  My partner has recently dealt with some issues with alcoholism.  Not severe to the point where he needed rehab, but severe enough to where he's started strictly moderating his alcohol intake, and has recently joined a support group.


I'd love to reward his hard work with some pizza to celebrate.  He has found an amazing support group for others in his situation, which has been really helpful and encouraging.


We live very close to a Dominoes, Pizza Hut, and Papa Murphys.  I was hoping to score a $15 gift card, it would be enough to get a medium pizza with the works at any of these locations.  Papa murphys has always been his favorite.


I have also recently returned to work after becoming injured, my first paycheck is arriving on the 16th of September.  I definitely plan on paying it forward once I get paid.  We have a decent homeless population in the area and I've been couponing to get some care packages put together (bagged lunch, tooth brush, tooth paste, couple of wash cloths, baby wipes, reusable water bottle, notepad and pen, stuff like this) to give out.  Or I can pay it forward on here, pizza-buyers choice :)  I'll be doing the care packages either way, but I'll have an extra $X to put towards it :P
