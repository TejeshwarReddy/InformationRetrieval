My husband, 10 month old son and I are in the middle of a move. He just got out of the military so we can't leave just yet even though all of our belongings are packed and have been picked up. The only thing we have to eat is ramen and being the moron I am, I packed all of our pots and our microwave...everything required to make ramen edible. Please don't make us eat cold and undercooked ramen tonight.
