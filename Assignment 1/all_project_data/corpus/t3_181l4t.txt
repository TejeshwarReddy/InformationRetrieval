I am currently between jobs, although I have one offer that is almost a done deal and I should begin working soon. I am struggling with my bills at the moment, although I'm seeking help from friends and family. My fridge is really bare, and any spare money I have is currently going toward paying my rent. "Luckily," I recently got a concussion and haven't had much of an appetite, so I can make what little food I get last longer. If anyone could help me eat for a few days, I would be incredibly grateful. I'll also pay it back as soon as I get back up on my feet, which hopefully won't be long. 

Thanks so much!
