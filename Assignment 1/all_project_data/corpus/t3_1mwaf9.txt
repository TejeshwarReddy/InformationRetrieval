Things have been a bit tight around here lately. Our kids (4 and 5 year old boys) have been asking for pizza for weeks and we always have to say no since our food budget is only enough for groceries, no extras. Our oldest got the best color possible in school Friday (purple!) for the first time and we'd love to celebrate with pizza.

We're hoping for just one more lean month before we're out of the hole and are able to pay it forward.  Thanks for reading!
