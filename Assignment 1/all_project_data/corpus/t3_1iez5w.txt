its not like I havent been trying, I have. mid summer is just the worst time in the world to apply for jobs. well that and after christmas so ive been told. I sent my resume out to different workpaces and have heard back from a few of them, i'd just like to keep my money in case things dont work out and im forced to wait a little while longer.
