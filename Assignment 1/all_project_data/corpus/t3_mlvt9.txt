Hey all! This is a throwaway, I've been lurking RAOP for quite a while and I'm really inspired by what's been going on, however never though I'd be on here asking.

I'm a student in Seattle and currently I have around 5$ for the next week. I'm looking for someone willing to get me a pizza that will last me the next few days until I get some money. 
Edit: It says "Alone". I recently moved to Seattle with no friends, and no family. 
Edit: That sounds too dismal, it's just boring.

I will return the favor with a pie later on this month. I love everything about RAOP and if someone helps me right now, I'd love to help in the future. I can provide a picture of me Omnoming it when it arrives. 
Thanks guys! &lt;3
