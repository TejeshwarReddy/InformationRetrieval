So finally moved out and after paying first and last I'm kind of short on cash. Last of my money went on groceries which didn't last too long. Waiting on my next pay check (Friday). 

Unfortunately didn't have much for saving because I went to summer school to get some extra credits.

I am willing to repay the favor Friday and provide my non throw away account :]. Normally I'd use my actual account but I don't want to let me friends or family know that I'm in a bit of a financial situation until my next pay check. 

Thank you in advance :]
