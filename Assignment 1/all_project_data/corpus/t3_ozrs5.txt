Hey everyone.

My mom is a registered NICU nurse. She works graveyards, 12 hours a shift, 3 nights a week. She worked last night and is working tonight as well. She works incredibly hard for our family.

While she's been asleep today, I've been working on cleaning the house. I'll admit, I'm a bit slacking on this subject and it's usually done by mom. 

I figured, what would be better than waking up to a clean house? How about waking up to a clean house AND dinner?

Unfortunately, I don't have any money. I've been unemployed for 2 months now and must put all of what I have left into my credit card bills.
It's kind of uncomfortable asking others to feed you and your family, but I figured it wouldn't hurt. I promise everyone here that I plan on buying some pies for others, regardless of anyone helping today or not.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this. Lets make my moms day!

P.s. we live around Sacramento, CA.
