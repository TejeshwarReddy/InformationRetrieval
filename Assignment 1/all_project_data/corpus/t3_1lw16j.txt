I dont want to eat from the public park trash.
Please we are sitting here anticipating eating. 

 Dont worry, the dog eats the cans i bought for him. Please someone help us, im on the verge of tears. We are homeless and our ebt does not come in until next week. I landed a job interview for monday, but dont want to celebrate with starvation. Please someone care.
