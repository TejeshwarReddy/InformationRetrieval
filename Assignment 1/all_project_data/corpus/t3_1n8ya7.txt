Only thing that's left in the house is a few packs of ramen and other little things, but a pizza would really be amazing. We have a full house here as well, so it would really be helpful. Thank you!  
Sadly there's no big pizza chains around, so we only have a local place called Pizza Plus.   
Edit: I'm unsure if you can use Paypal online, but you can use a card over the phone, if that helps.
