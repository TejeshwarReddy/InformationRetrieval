I am 23, have been in the service industry for 9 years, currently work at a sushi restaurant last night was the busiest night of the year. Worked a 12 hour shift last night drank champagne at midnight and then finished mopping the floors. I was just hitting random and stumbled upon RAOP. I THOUGHT I had 20 bucks in my bank but my netflix went through today. I got paid yesterday but the money wont hit my bank account until Tuesday morning because the owners of my place have crappy checks that the bank atm does not recognize.
If someone is gracious enough to reward me I will hold a contest Tuesday to Repay the favor. ORRRRR if you are located in Austin come into the restaurant I work at sit at the sushi bar and will give a solid hookup on some of the best sushi you will have in town.
