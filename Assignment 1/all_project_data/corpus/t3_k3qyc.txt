Hey there RAOP, I'm currently at home with my brother and we are really hungry. My mom has little to no money and won't be able to go food shopping for another 2 days. I was wondering if any of you would be kind enough to supply us with a pizza for tonight :] I've only lurked in here, so I don't really know if it's a crazy thing to request pizza hut. Thanks &lt;3

Edit: Thanks to Yarrg for hooking us up! Greatly appreciated!
