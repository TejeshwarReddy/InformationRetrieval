Hey guys,

This is a throwaway account, I'm more than willing to go through the verification system if need be.  

I could really use a helping hand right now.  I've been unemployed for 6 months now, haven't been able to find much work in Birmingham other than some manual labor.  I'm not complaining, I'll do anything I have to support myself.  I'm trying to cut out all expenses in my life, got rid of my phone, internet, sold my tv, so I'm in the library using their internet and their AC.

To add insult to injury, rubbing dirt on the wound, I had to put down my chocolate lab over the weekend.  Layla was getting old, she was a great lab, and I'm torn up inside right now.

I know it's childish, but I would love to sit down with a nice pizza, something I haven't had in as long as I can remember and just kinda zone out, at least for the night.
