Last week I deposited my paycheck but for some reason Regions decided to not make the funds available for 3 days, so after using my debit card a few times, I'm now officially -$412 in the hole.  I get paid again tomorrow, and I do have 1 package of ramen left, but I'm 25 weeks pregnant and it's just not going to cut it for the whole day.  So, if anyone is feeling generous I would greatly appreciate a little help!
Edit - I realize since I'm using a throwaway this may seem suspicious, but I can provide proof to anyone who wants it.  Empty fridge, ultrasound pic, etc.
