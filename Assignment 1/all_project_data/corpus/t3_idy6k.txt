hey guys! my friend and i are probably going to be up all night working on the final papers for our summer class and we'd love a study break.
we're both the first people in our families to go to college (our parents are all immigrants) and we're at an Ivy League university on very, very generous financial aid. help us out, school is hard. ease our pain with pizza!
