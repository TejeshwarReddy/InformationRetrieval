I'm residing in Jacksonville, Fl. and my parents are out of town for the week. Im with my 8 year old brother and we don't have much unexpired food aside from ramen noodles. I don't have any physical money(at least not enough to order food) and it would be nice to be able to order pizza for ourselves. Obviously this is a somewhat trivial situation and there are people who's situations deserve to be prioritized over this but if you are in a situation where we are the ideal choice that would be awesome. 
Edit: Has received pizza from the lovely redditor, makoswimmer &lt;3
