The title pretty much sums it up, but my friend's in town for a few days before he gets deployed to South Korea for a year. Tonight's the goodbye party for him and his girlfriend, who's moving to Pennsylvania for school. I'm from out of town and spent all my money on gas driving up to see them, and the party host spent all his money on the booze. Anyway, if anyone would be willing to support our army hero with a pizza, we would appreciate and pay it forward when we're able. :]

EDIT: Should probably mention that we're in the Coeur d'Alene, ID/Spokane, WA area.
