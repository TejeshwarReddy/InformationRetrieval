Fellow Floridian Redditors,

I'm coming to you all with my hat in hand, looking for a bit of help.  I'm way down on my luck, hoping to catch a break for once.  I've been working construction in the hot Florida heat for the past 4 months, and have made a total of $958, before taxes.

I've been forced to move back in with my parents, something I swore I'd never do.  I'm sad, depressed, sunburned as hell, tired and praying for some generosity.

If anyone out there has it in their heart to help out a guy who has been busting his butt to make ends meat, I'd truly appreciate it.
