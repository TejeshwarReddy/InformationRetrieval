Woke up with a massive headache and sore throat, so ended up missing work. Tried to play some games to relax, but had constant losses(why do I play competitive games to relax? lol). Pretty much out of food and don't get paid until tomorrow, so food would be appreciated. :D

Now, don't take me as desperate. Worst case scenario I'm hungry for one night and have plenty of food tomorrow. Still, I'd appreciate a pizza!

Edit: Near Boston, Massachusetts.
