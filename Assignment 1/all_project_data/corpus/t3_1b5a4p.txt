Hey all. Long story short my girlfriend recently had to move from home to Montreal, QC for work. She was told that she would be taxed in Ontario, but it turns out she is being taxed in Quebec. **That is a huge difference.** Her budget is shot and she really has no money left for food.

 I will help her out a little bit but i am unemployed and living in Ontario still. Please Help me cheer my girlfirend up! I can honestly say i will make an effort to pay this forward.
