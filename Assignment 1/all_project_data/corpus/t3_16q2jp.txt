That's my only request. This sub has turned into a bad episode of Dr. Phil... This is supposed to be fun and random, not acts of sympathy pizza. 

I hate to sound heartless, but come on! Everybody has problems and should try and deal with them on their own time. If your dog dies, or you lose your job, I do feel bad for you, but that isn't what this sub is about. You should be with your family and feiends, not trying to figure out deep dish or thin-n-crispy from Pizza Hut... 

It has become a pity party, not a pizza party. Let's keep the crying to a minimum... 

Downvote if you must, but this is my only request. Let's keep this lighthearted... Sorry for the rant fellow pizza lovers... Keep on pizza-ing on...
