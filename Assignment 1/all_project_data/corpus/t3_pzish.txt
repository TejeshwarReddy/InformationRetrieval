We just moved to MD in January and still trying to get caught up in bills, and I'm just trying to break up the cycle of rice and pasta that we've been on for the last week and a half.  I'm okay with still eating the same stuff until we get paid, but I want him to be happy and I don't have the money right now to treat him to a bacon pizza from Domino's. :\
