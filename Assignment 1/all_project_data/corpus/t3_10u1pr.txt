I am a recently seperated mother of two wonderful kids. My husband walked out on us for someone else and left us high and dry. I have been a homemaker for 10 years. I'm actively looking for work and awaiting foodstamp benefits. It would be fantastic if a gracious redditor could randomly pick us for dinner tonight. My account is brand new but I guess everyone has to start somewhere.
