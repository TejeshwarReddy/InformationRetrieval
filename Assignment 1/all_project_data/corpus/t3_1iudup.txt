~~I've been lurking here for a while, but never had the need to request or the money to offer.~~

~~I'm scraping the bottom of my cupboards and it's only the 22nd. This month has been really tight and I've been eating nothing but peanut butter jelly sandwiches and ramen for the past week because that's all there is left. I just got hired into a fast food job, so I'll be able to pay it forward next month for sure.~~

~~I'm in the US.. anything more specific I'd be happy to tell you over PM!~~

Edit: Just in case you don't read into the comments, I was not referred here by [Wired or their article.](http://i.imgur.com/uYhdVT9.jpg) I've been on Reddit for 2 1/2 years and knew about RAoP long before that article was printed.

Edit2: Thank you for the pizza, ChairmanW! You're awesome!
