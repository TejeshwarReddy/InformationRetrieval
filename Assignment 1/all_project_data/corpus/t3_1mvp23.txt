Hey RAoP!

Tomorrow (Sunday Sept 22) is my only day off of work for the next 3 weeks. I would really enjoy being lazy and not having to cook, and with the rainy day that its supposed to be a pizza would be fantastic.

Will use Verification System.

I'm off to sleep for now, have a good night everyone!
