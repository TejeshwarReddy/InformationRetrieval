I just want to say, "thank you," in advanced to all you kind souls.  I'm at a breaking point today and I really, REALLY *despise* asking for handouts but I've had a couple nervous breakdowns since this AM.

**Here's my situation:** I'm beyond broke.  A couple of medical bills from the end of last year have put me WAY off my budget and I'm trying desperately to catch up. I'm behind on my mortgage, car and lights. On top of that I got stopped yesterday by the police while travelling from one job to the next and found out my license has been suspended from an old fine I forgot to pay.  So this morning I had to get my license straight, which costed $275 that I didn't have.  The best part was finding out on the way home this AM that my water got cut off.  That costed me another $180 that I didn't have.  I've never been so desperate in my life.

I need help, more help than a single pizza, I know, but one meal would mean the world for me right now.  I've got nothing in the cupboards to cook tonight and the money I was planning to buy dinner with is GONE.  I get paid tomorrow so a little kindness tonight would go such a long way.  

I have three children and they are the real reason I'm asking for this tonight. I have a daughter, 9YOA, and twin boys, 2YOA.  One of my sons has a congenital heart defect and has been through three surgeries.  I'm a paramedic and I'm working as hard as I can to provide for my kids and allow my wife to finish school.  

I can provide proof if needed through PMs.  Please, someone, find it in your heart to assist me this one time.  I don't ever ask anybody for anything, I'm usually the one helping others.
