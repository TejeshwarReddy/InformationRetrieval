Hello there, I am a single parent who's been ravaged by this 5 day blackout here in Waukegan.  I've had to empty hundreds of dollars worth of food from my once cold refrigerator.  My kids are constantly asking for take-out however I cannot afford it.  I would be greatly appreciative of anyone who could help a family in need out.  We were ravaged by storms recently which have left us in a 5 day blackout as of yet.  I hope some redditer reads this and has sympathy for our situation.  Willing to provide pics of our empty fridge and our neighborhood in the morning when there is light to see the devastation.
  I hope all is well with the community and wish everyone a good night.
