Hi all, I am a college student, ran out of food today. I don't get paid until tomorrow, so until then I'm just sitting around trying to conserve energy. Judging from my pantry, my roommates would enjoy a slice as well. :) I would love it if someone could feed me tonight, and so I can help feed my roommate as well. Thanks, everyone!

I also have a verification code, if that helps. Also, I honestly don't need much. I have very little money, enough to cover half a pizza. Anything would help.
