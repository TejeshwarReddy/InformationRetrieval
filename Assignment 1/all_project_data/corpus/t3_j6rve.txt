I was just laid off today, due to my original job being phased out of existence. While I have been as accommodating as possible to make my employers see my ability to learn new things and excel at every job put in my path, they decided because I haven't worked there as long as others I got laid off. It was also implied that the last position I was training for couldn't be done by me because I'm a girl. (Apparently being a girl means I can't use a wrench or climb a ladder.) Unfortunately because it wasn't out right said, I can do no legal action. Could really use an upside to this day.

**Edit: Thank you so much to *unmoderated* for the gift of pizza and literature! You made my day infinitely better!**
