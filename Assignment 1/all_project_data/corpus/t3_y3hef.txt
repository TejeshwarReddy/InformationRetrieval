I have been clean for a year and I'm still trying to get my life back together. My mother has been my rock through all of this and I would like to have a nice family dinner tonight. There's no way I could ever repay her for everything she has done for me. I want to thank her for having a hand in my sobriety as well as never giving up on me. If someone could help my family have a nice meal today, I promise to post pictures. Please help make my 1 year clean a real celebration. 

We are in Des Moines, Iowa. If you're in the area, you're more than welcomed to join us. Thank you.
