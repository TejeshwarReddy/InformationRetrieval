Title says it all. Just got out of class and I want nothing more than a pizza while doing homework and studying. I have ten bucks to my name which is going to have to go to gas in order for me to get to and from campus. I do have a gig (freelance video guy, here) next week that I'll more than happily use the cash from to pay it forward.
