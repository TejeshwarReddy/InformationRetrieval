Moving has sapped my bank accounts. I'm not starving or anything, but I've been eating nothing but peanut butter and jelly sandwhiches since Monday, and that's getting pretty old. 

Is there a stranger that can help me eat something different tonight?

My paycheck doesn't get deposited until tomorrow, at which point I will certainly pay it forward. 

Also, I am new to this subreddit. I think I understand how it all works, but bear with me. I am happy to provide verification/etc.
