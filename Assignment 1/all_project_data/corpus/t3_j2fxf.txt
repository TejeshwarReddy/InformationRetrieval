You know the song, Dean Martin, "When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's Amore!"

Well RAOP, I come to you with a humble request.

My girlfriend took me out for Chinese the other night, after I insisted that I eat nothing, because of not being able to pay/pay her back, she ordered her meal, then what she knows I like because, well, she's awesome.

I would like to be able to share a pizza with her this week, to A. Demonstrate how amazing this subreddit is, and B. To respond, in kind, to her generous gift to me. 

I am not in dire need. This is a request that is desire-based. I have enough Rice and Ramen to last me for quite some time. So if there are other needs that supersede mine, no worries, I encourage you to use your discretion and give to those who, based on your own criteria, would appreciate it most. 

Other than that, I will pledge that for every dollar of pizza I receive via this subreddit, I will, within a month, pay it forward two-fold. So know that your gift of one pizza, will become a gift of two pizzas for others very soon. (As soon as I get a second job, to which I am actually leaving for an interview now.)
