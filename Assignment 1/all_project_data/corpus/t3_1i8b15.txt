I've been broke and jobless, and waiting to hear back from a few places. Ive been trying my best to eat what I have around the house. Eating cereal everyday has been getting very tiresome and I was going to invite some friends over and would love to be able to offer them something besides a box of corn flakes. Thank you to anyone out there who is willing to give a pizza to a person in need.
