My fellow redditors, this week has probably taken the cake (or pizza? please say pizza) for worst week of my life. Two weeks ago my SO and I went to visit our respective parents in our hometown. SO had just gotten his Masters and we were there to celebrate. SO grandmother has a heart attack the day after we arrive and is in the hospital the whole time we're there. She died 3 separate times and was revived. All planned celebrations are (rightfully) ceased. Return home a week and some later after grandma is stable to find that our power bill is in arrears thanks to a shitty roommate we had and they are threatening to shut off our power. They refuse to work out any kind of payment plan and more or less tell us 'all or nothing' by 6pm tomorrow or we're out of luck. Next, find out the oven mysteriously broke while we were away and can no longer cook anything decent. Found this out after I attempted to cook a frozen pizza and was horrified by the half cooked doughy mess slithering through the oven rack. Don't know where I'm getting the money for the power bill and probably going to have to pick up stakes and move back home... but please reddit, if I can use anything right now it's a random act of pizza. 

**TLDR: SO and I returned from visiting sick family member to discover our power is going to be turned off tomorrow; oven died and mangled a frozen pizza we were going to have for supper.**
