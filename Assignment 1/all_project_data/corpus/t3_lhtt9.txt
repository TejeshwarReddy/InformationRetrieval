I'm an art student and I do Web Development to support myself. I've been waiting to get paid for a week, and am close to running out of food completely. Can't buy anymore till I get the check in the mail. Chances are it won't be here till Monday at the earliest.

A pizza would really raise my spirits. I live in the Chicago area.
