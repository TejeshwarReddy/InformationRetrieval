[I am a miserable failure when it comes to making anything. Even heating up corn dogs.](http://i.imgur.com/IxgXi.jpg)

I was given this convection microwave. I guess i'm not sure how it works fully. But there went my dinner for tonight. I might try corndogs again tomorrow night, as it's the only thing I actually have to eat, but well, tonight i'm a little bit frustrated with the whole corn dog adventures and my microwave (and house) smells like the inside of mordor.

can provide a verification code if need be.

If no one feels the need to help out, no worries. I'll figure something out. My dad bought me a burger for lunch today so I can make it till tomorrow. :) This place is still awesome.

EDIT: Forgot to add that i'm in Utah.
