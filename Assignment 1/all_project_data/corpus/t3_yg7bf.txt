My name is SPC Collins. I am stationed at Fort Hood, Texas. Been here all of 2 months, and am already having money issues. (which I'll admit is purely my fault.. Except for Hertz Rental Car, the 1400$ they told me was coming out daily, then just yanked out of the account in one day, royally screwed me..) No I am not in dire need or starving, but I have had a pizza craving from heck the past 2-3 weeks. If it helps my birthday was the 8th, and no I did not get a pizza then. I also deploy in less then 2 months. Will return any help when possible, either directly to the contributer, or to the community.
