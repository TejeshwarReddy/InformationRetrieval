Title says it all mostly.  We spent that much because two of my classes required a revised edition of a book that started print this year and that came with a code for online software so we can do our homework online.  They were both $200+ each. 

We literally have no money for food in our room other then Ramen Noodles and our cafeteria sucks.  They literally make more vegan options for lunch dinner then they do non vegan food.  Its horrible.

Could a kind redditor please help us out and provide us with some good ol Pizza for once?  The past 2 months have been miserable.
