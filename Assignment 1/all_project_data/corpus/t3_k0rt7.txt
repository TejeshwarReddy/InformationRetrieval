I really hate to ask to ask because I'm such an independent person, but I got "laid off" (Problems with my boss, I won't get into it..) a few weeks ago and I've just been coasting on savings trying to find a new job. I'd be happy to entertain any requests or anything that could bring some happiness to someone's life as compensation for doing the same for me.
