I'm writing this on behalf of my friends, They're currently stuck in PA on a 2 week long tour. They spent most of all the money they had on a smaller repair the day before. I donated what I could yesterday, but a $2,700 repair today has crippled them. I can communicate the terms, I'm positive these fun loving guys will send you T-shirts and silly pics. But we can discuss if you want them to write a song or something.
