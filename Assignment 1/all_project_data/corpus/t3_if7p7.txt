Hello, I was informed about this site through someone. Both my roommate and I share funds and our bank account is at 4 dollars till Friday. We thought we would just be able to go without food till then but our rumbling tummies tell us other wise. If anyone would be kind enough to send a pizza our way we would greatly send someone a pizza once we get paid even tough our pay will be cut short being my roommate had taken a week off due to being sick . Thank you to anyone who is willing to help.
