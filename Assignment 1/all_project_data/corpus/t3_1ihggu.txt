I am really trying to finish my first project till the end of this week, I am now really stressed out as I fell behind with my previous plan and am currently running out of ideas about what to write, have to work everyday at 6pm which significantly cuts my time to fully dedicate the entire day to my university projects, staying at work till 1am. 

I am financially dried out and get paid on the 25th which is next week. I would appreciate pepperoni pizza if anyone would be willing to help. There is Domino's pizza here in Canterbury, UK. 

Cliche maybe, I know... but I am telling the truth... (the good old: who would lie on the internet, right? :) )

Thanks!!!
