Pretty much what it says above, and I'm not picky about pizza in the least. Let me know if you're feeling generous :) Little bit more info, I'm curled up on a couch with my cat, watching Breaking bad, I'm on Series 4 EP 8. Not to mention an overdrawn bank account, get paid Friday. I promise to pay it forward either equal or greater Friday to a worthy redditer that posts on here, or pay it back at a later date.
