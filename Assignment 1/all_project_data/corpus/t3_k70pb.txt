It's been a rough couple of days. Didn't get my paycheck before labor day like I was supposed to, won't get it until sometime tomorrow if I'm lucky. They also cut my hours in half at an already part time job. Found out that my childhood home in Bastrop burnt down, here's my [Facebook Post](http://imgur.com/OMho5) about it. 
I'm hungry, I'm out of cigs, and generally stressed out about everything. Just would like a pizza to help make it til tomorrow.
