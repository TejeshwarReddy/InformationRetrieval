Hey reddit, this has basically been the worst week of my life. My car window was broken, I'm looking at being evicted from my gf's parents house, making us both homeless, and my snake that I've had since birth just got eaten by a cat. We're not allowed to eat the food in the kitchen an I can't afford any food. Help?
