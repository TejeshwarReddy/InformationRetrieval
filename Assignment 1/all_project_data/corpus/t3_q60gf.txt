Well, my boyfriend and I have spent an inordinate amount of money this month on unexpected stuff. My laptop stopped working, and I had to spend the majority of my meager savings on a new one. Our hedgehog got sick and vet bills also took a good chunk of money from us. The only things we have left to eat are grits, eggs, and rice, and while it's enough to live on for now, I'm tired of eating it. Just one pizza would be great, I'm not picky about where it's from. Thanks to anyone who reads this.
