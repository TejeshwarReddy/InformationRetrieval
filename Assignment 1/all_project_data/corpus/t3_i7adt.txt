Hi guys! Thank you to all the people who have helped someone in need, you truly are amazing people. Long story short, I'm out of money and quite low on food for the next week or so, mainly due to the fact that I was forced to go to the ER last Friday because of a serious burn on my foot and, of course, I don't have any insurance. This wiped out my whole bank account, which then got overdrawn due to car insurance and a couple of checks that I had written a few days before. I'm starving tonight and I've basically only eaten fried eggs and toast this whole week. I understand if no one can help, but if anyone can help me out with some food for the night I would never forget it. As soon as I can get my bank account back in the positive I will definitely hop on here and help someone in need. I don't really know how this works (do you order it over the internet usually? Do I have to cover the tip?) so bear with me if it takes a couple of PM's. I'll be on Reddit all night, as usual, so I should respond quite quickly to any offers. Once again, thank all of you! Peace and love.

**EDIT:** I thought it might help to point out that I live very close to downtown, so there are a pretty healthy amount of pizza places that would deliver. Thanks!
