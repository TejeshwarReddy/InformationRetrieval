I am here asking for a Pizza dinner for my family,My son has been asking for Pizza which has now made everyone want
Pizza but its not something we can afford at this time.After bills there isn't a lot of money left for food,We receive 
food stamps but you can't buy real pizza on food stamps. We haven't had real pizza for a place like papa johns,dominos,
ect for I am not sure how long because I can't remember the last time normally we have to stick with frozen pizza
from the grocery store.I am not sure if this request will get granted but I wanted to let everyone know how wonderful
this site is I was told about this site by my mother who was told by one of our neighbors. 

There are five of us living here: Myself,My boyfriend,My mother,&amp; my two teenagers,Normally three pizzas is enough for
everyone to get 2/3 slices each,Extras aren't even necessary just pizza would make us more than happy. I was provided a 
verification code &amp; can give that to anyone who is needing it. I can also provide a photo of my mother holding up a sign 
with todays date [I just got home from a long days work &amp; look horrible so I am too embarrassed to take a photo] at this 
time my boyfriend is still at work &amp; my kids will be home in about an hour - two hours. Thank you for taking the time to 
read this it isn't a life threatening need we would just really like to have some fresh just baked mouth watering pizza &amp;
can provide pictures of the Pizza afterward.
