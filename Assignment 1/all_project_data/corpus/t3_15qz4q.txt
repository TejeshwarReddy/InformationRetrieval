I am a broke ass college student (senior at Kennesaw State) and I won't be getting any money until the end of January. I'll probably be eating at the local shelter for the rest of the month. Would really just enjoy some good hot food tonight so that 2012 doesn't have to go out miserably in hunger. Thanks. Happy New Year! I hope 2013 brings great things to all you wonderful people.
