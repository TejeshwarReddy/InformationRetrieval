As a rock climber and guitarist, I've been bummed out since I screwed up my elbow ten days ago. I'm behind on rent, bills, and loans already, forgot about automatic bill pay this Monday, and I am overdrafted until my low-pay check on Friday. [Can't get this melancholy but beautiful song out of my head](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ5isLBu_To).

Chicken is nice, and these are definitely First World (Boston) college student troubles. My light at the end of the tunnel is a comp sci Bachelor's (and job?) in December, but, man, pizza sounds like pure love right now.


Edit: The unassuming delivery guy handed me an unexpected cold soda and set of garlic bread, along with a huge pizza laden with sausage, prosciutto, and peppers. I couldn't stop grinning. A thousand thanks to anthonybsd!
