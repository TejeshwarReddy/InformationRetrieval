My husband got deployed last month and I decided to use all my food money on the best possible gift for him since he is sacrificing so much for me. I have been living on that crap at the back of the cupboards for the last two weeks, and am pretty much out-the only thing left is a box of macaroni and cheese, but no milk or butter to make it with

Yesterday I got a conformation email from UPS saying the package was delivered saturday...it was not. We decided to wait until today to see if the package was just at the local office, but it didn't come today either. The package is gone. I'm in an apartment complex (in California, neer the bay area) and I think the UPS guy left it at the door and someone snagged it. 

I'm not used to asking strangers for anything...but I am on the verge of a break down and haven't eaten anything filling in weeks. 

We are usually fine when it comes to money, so once our paycheck on the 15th comes I will send a pizza back to whoever sends me one today. 

TL;DR (yes, I know I'm a ranter) my husbands deployed, I'm depressed, his awesome christmas gift was stolen, and now I have no money for groceries. If you send me pizza I will return the favor when my paycheck comes.
