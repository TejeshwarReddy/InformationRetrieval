So by a series of bad timing and bureaucratic paperworkery my unemployment benefits are in limbo. I haven't had benefits for a month, when I should have (they're reviewing my case, which is standard procedure but they're behind so their 2 week time frame has morphed into a five week time frame), I'm just frustrated and broke, but I should be getting money monday (finally), and a pizza could feed me all weekend.

I hope this doesn't sound too much like begging. If it doesn't happen it doesn't happen. Of course when I'm back on my feet I will pizza this forward to someone who needs it at that time.
