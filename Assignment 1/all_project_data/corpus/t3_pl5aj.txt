So... My roomates just left out to go food shopping. They both rely soley on food stamps for groceries. I'm out of work, they help me with food when they can. I am sure they will buy me something to eat (something I haven't had the luxury of doing as of yet today), but that won't be for some time... and I would really like to have something waiting for them to eat when they come back. I know it would make their day. I'm currently babysitting their kids who are getting a little ~~crazy~~ restless. I know food will be here eventually, so if you can give to someone who won't eat otherwise, please do. Barring that, it would really make my day and occupy the mouths of these rugrats lol.

Edit: All is well, food has arrived and smells delicious. crisis averted. no pizzas needed here. thank you for the time and consideration though.
