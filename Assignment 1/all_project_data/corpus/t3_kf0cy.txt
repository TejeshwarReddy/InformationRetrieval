So, I'm unemployed. Haven't gotten enough financial aid. Ineligible for unemployment because I didn't make enough money at my last job. Majorly stressed. And to top it all, I might get evicted because the person I'm subletting from hasn't paid the landlord for 2 months. Once I pay my rent and utilities for this month (both on hold on landlord's orders until they sort out the mess) I'll have about $30 left. Unless I find a job soon or get approved for additional financial aid (my department told me to go screw myself on grants and assistantships), I'm screwed in a serious way. I really could use a pizza though.
