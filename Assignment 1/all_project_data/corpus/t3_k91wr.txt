Located in Ottawa, Canada

Due to some issues with a previous employer my wifes EI was cut really short unexpectantly. Because of this funds have been extreemly tight around the house. This week has been the first week back at school for my son who is in Grade 4. My son suffers from Aspergers and was really nervous about going back to schoo due to diciplin issues in the past. The last 3 days he has tried really hard and after speaking with his teacher today (She mentions hes putting lots of effort in) I would love to reward him with some nice yummy pizza.

Want to say thanks in advance! And I honestly cant wait to be in a better situation to return the favor to the community
