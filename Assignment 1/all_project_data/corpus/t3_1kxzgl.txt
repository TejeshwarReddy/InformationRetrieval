Folks I need your help. My co worker has a cousin that is having a setback with Financial Aid. Her cousin has not eaten in 3 days. I know for fact my co-worker would not lie to us, we are a very close-knit department part of a major company. I have already [sent](http://i.imgur.com/i11XkFu.png) a Pizza Hut Gift Card for $25 and a few of us have already donated. Anything you would like to share as well would be appreciated. 

She does not know I am posting this here, nor does she know what reddit is.
