Yea..

This was a new job that I really enjoyed after 3 months of unemployment and filling applications. Rent's paid, thank goodness, but I've already promised the power company my paycheck (and then some). I've got some food to last me the end of the week but just don't want to start the ramen already. I could use a pizza for dinner tonight, guys, and a smile. 2012's been rough.
