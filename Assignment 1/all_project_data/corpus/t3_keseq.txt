Hello RAOP!
As the title says we're two guys, just finished highschool, starting college in two weeks. We're from mid Europe, spending the end of our holidays in Canada, Montreal, staying in a 2-starred hotel.

Respecting the rules - no making up stories - I can't say we are completely cashless. But I sure can say we're running short with it, and we still need some for subway, and buses.

We'd appreciate just anything! Thank you very much guys.
