Hello there. I'm not thrilled about asking, but myself, my roommate, and my girlfriend are quite hungry. The three of us have a class through dinner on Tuesdays/Thursdays, and this week, there's just nothing left in our fridge to cook, and none of us gets paid until tomorrow.

If any redditors are around and would like to donate a pizza to our cause, we'd be very thankful!
