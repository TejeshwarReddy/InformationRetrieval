Wasn't really looking for handouts or whatever when I posted that, still not really - this subreddit popped up in the sidebar.

I used to do a lot of work in SecondLife, and often I would get people to pay me in pizza.  When I was capable, I gifted people in pizza as well.  I like the idea of sharing a meal rather than being paid directly, seems more friendly.  I'll see what I can do to eventually become a pizza gifter here.

Anyway, if you feel like gifting me a pizza, there is a mom and pop pizza shop I can walk to here you could call and order a pizza directly.  They have a deal mon - wed with a medium one topping for $5.99, or large for like $2 more.  A while back, I had a friend order me a pizza directly with them, no problem.  I'm simple pizza wise - like pepperoni with extra sauce.

I've been living mostly off of ramen (cold-cooked as I have no stove) and dollar menu at McDs, so  pizza would actually be nice.

This is a really cool subreddit.  Hopefully I'll be able to repay the kindness sooner rather than later by passing on a pizza to someone else in need.

I live mid-way down the east coast, and will get more specific when I give whoever the details.  I wasn't asked for the card the time before, I'm thinking an out of state order would be fine.

Wow, if someone does this, thanks so much!  If not, still glad I found this subreddit.  Cool concept - great way to get some actual kharma :D
