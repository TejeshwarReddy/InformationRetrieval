My husband left recently for a 6 week military TDY and I'm stuck here alone in this house this week with no way to get anywhere until I leave to visit my family. Our funds are really short, and I'm starting to feel like a crazy cat lady eating soup all day. My cats Friskies is starting to look good. 

Pizza would be amazingly appreciated, it solves hunger AND loneliness =]
