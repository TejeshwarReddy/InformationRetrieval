No pitiful sob story here; I have a paypal account with enough money in it to buy pizza, however, Domino's doesn't accept paypal in the US and I don't have any other money. I'll gladly repay the cost of the pizza once it arrives at my door. PM me for order and address and whatever else you need.

Thanks in advance, RAoP!
