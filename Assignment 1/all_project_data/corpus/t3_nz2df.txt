So last night at my NYE party, some people my friends brought knocked over my soup I had made to last all week while trying to cram more beer into the fridge, it sucked. It was some kickass recipe I found on r/dollarfriendlymeals.

So that blew, also they didn't even eat most of what I had left out for munching. People suck sometimes. If you feel like hooking up Mr. Wexler with some Za, I would appreciate it, Brah.

Get it? Za Brah.

I apologize for that last part.
