So, my roommate and I both have a whole pile of work to conquer tonight...I myself have about 100 pages of reading as well as a 6 page essay to write, all due before noon tomorrow. My roommate, who is an Occupational Therapy Major and I don't envy in the slightest, has a whole barrel of memorization and classification notes to work with. We're both going to be up all night and neither of our pay checks come in until tomorrow.

If a good Samaritan provided us with a delicious pie, we'd be forever grateful! Our location is in Ithaca, NY.
