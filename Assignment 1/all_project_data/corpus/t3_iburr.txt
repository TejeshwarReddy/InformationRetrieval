My fridge broke 4 weeks ago and I've been surviving on the remaining junk food I have left and sometimes I go out in the supermarket to look for free food samples. I don't have much left in my place except for half bag of gold fish crackers and 2 bottles of soda. Most of my food got rotten and now I don't have much left to eat... I'm still looking for a cheap affordable fridge to replace the broken one. I'm an unemployed college student living with my sister in a small apartment and would love to eat something nice for one day. I haven't had pizza for a long time and would love if someone could help me out. 
Thank you!
