So here's the breakdown, my friend and I attend this university in OH, we've been long time lurkers of RAoP and have talked about doing it once we have some money. As it stands now I have about $2.66 in my account and my roommate has $0.00 due to Jimmy Johns screwing him over with a pending transaction that he cancelled but it still displays as pending. As we do attend a small university there are only two places that deliver here, Donatos and Golden Crust (A local place). If someone does fulfill this request I can guarantee both of us will repay RAoP in the near future (We get our Fin Aid refund checks on Tuesday).

If anyone wants any more info just shoot me a message!

Thanks,
