My fiancee had surgery last week, so I took some time off of work to stay home with her for a few days.  I was going to go grocery shopping when I got off work tonight, but when I went out to my car this morning, I had a flat tire with some sort of nail/spike sticking out of the side.  I had to buy a new tire so I can get back and forth to work.

Friday, I got paid $112, giving me a total of just under $120 in my account.  The tire and labor came out to a little over $118, leaving me 82 cents in my account to last until Friday (payday).  So I wasn't able to buy groceries tonight.  

In the fridge, we have half a pack of american cheese, a head of lettuce, and soy milk.  In the cabinet, we have a pack of ramen, three slices of bread, and some chocolate syrup.  We live week to week, and we have a grocery budget, and we plan out a weekly menu, buying just what we need for that week's meals.

I'm not going to pretend I've been on Reddit forever.  I created this account 8 months ago, but I never post.  I just come in once in a while to look at the funny stuff.  Tonight, I read an ABC news article about ROAP, and figured it was worth a shot.  If anyone is willing to help me out, we can survive on pizza for two days easily.    It's just my fiancee and myself.  

I'm posting links to a screenshot of my bank balance, a photo of the tire receipt, and my latest paystub.

Thank you ahead of time for any help, and if no one can help, I still appreciate your taking the time to read all of this.  I know it's a lot, but the guidelines said to include details.  We have a Dominoe's down the street from us.

So, yeah.  Thanks again, either way.
