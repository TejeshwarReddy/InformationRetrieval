My girlfriend and I are going through some really hard times financially. Rent is due tomorrow, and we're still two hundred dollars short. There's no food left in the cupboards, and every single cent we own needs to go to rent. 

Times are really hard. I don't think we've ever been this stressed out before, and I don't think I've ever had this many panic attacks. I am unemployed, and despite the hundreds and hundreds of applications I filled out, I remain without an income. She works hard to support us both through these hard times, but I can tell it's really wearing down on her. We went to bed without dinner last night, and I woke up to the sound of her softly sobbing into the pillow.

I don't have much to offer in return, but we can work something out. I'm a writer, maybe you need a report written or something? I own essays. I'm like Will Ferrel in Undeclared.

I need a pizza not only because we need to eat, but because I need to be reminded that we haven't bottomed out, and that things will get better. I'm losing hope, fast. 

We live in Portland, OR.
