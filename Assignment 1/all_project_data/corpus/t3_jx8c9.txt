Hey guys, hope everyone is having a nice Sunday.  Sure is beautiful here in NC.  I'll be honest, I'm starving :D  I've made it since Friday without food but desperate times call for desperate acts.  I get paid tomorrow and I'd be willing to trade some pizza today for some pizza tomorrow.  Very new to this subreddit but I could repay the sender with pizza tomorrow or provide for someone else in need.  Happy to verify with any information needed.
