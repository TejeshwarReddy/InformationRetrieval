Dota 2's The International 3 is this weekend (popular competitive video game).  I'm not as close to my brother as I would like.  He's 8 years younger than me.  We've had our differences in the past.  

I've invited him to come down to NYC for the geek-out tournament watching weekend.  He's old enough now and I'll also buy him drinks and expect to have a jolly good time.

If anyone would like to participate in this brotherly bond in the making, you're more than welcome to!  He arrives tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks!

[edit] brotherly, not botherly. LOL.
