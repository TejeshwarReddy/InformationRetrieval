Hi, ROAP. I'm in a bit of a bind until Friday - I thought the money I was pulling from my savings/mutual fund for living expenses would be here by today but I just called USAA and they said it won't be available until Friday. I'm good on rent, utilities, and gas until then but I have two apples to my name and only have $38 (soon to be $13 after I go to the doctor's tomorrow). Living on a pizza and probably some more fruit that I pick up tomorrow won't be super healthy, but it'll get me to Friday =)

Verification code available, other pics available on request. Thank you vm in advance.
