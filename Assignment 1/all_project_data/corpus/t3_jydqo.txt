Here I am at work. With my coworker. Were here until 9:30 and realize neither of us has our wallets.. Wed love a pizza. And he already said to me he'd go halfsies on repaying the favor next time we work together, for someone else on here! Were in NH right now and will be here until 9:30 eastern time. So if someone wants to feed us it'd be lovely :]
