I'm currently in my second year of a Computer Science degree at the University of Maryland.  I've been living on loans and a part-time job for the summer, but due to a paperwork screw-up I'm currently between loans.  On top of THAT I had to sink 500 bucks into my beater car to replace the brake pads.  I'm down to about 100 dollars on my credit limit and 30 bucks in my debit account - just crossing my fingers each day that I hear back from the financial aid office.  I'm so sick of ramen day in and day out, and I spend minutes at a time fantisizing about a fresh, hot pizza.  It would make me feel so much better.
