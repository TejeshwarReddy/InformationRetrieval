I work a manual labor job, and I'm so hungry right now.  This is my first time doing this, so if someone is willing to help me out, then I guess I'm supposed to do whatever you want, like show you a screenshot of my bank account balance or take a picture of a blue Dodge Neon or something.  All of you are the people that make RAOP go, so I leave it up to you, in good faith, to make me dance on whatever level is necessary.

I also give my word that after being paid tomorrow, I'll gladly help someone else out tomorrow night.
