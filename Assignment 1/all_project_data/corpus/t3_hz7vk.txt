Hey Reddit, I heard about this sub-reddit for a little while now, and think its an awesome idea. I'm a 24 year old college student from South-West Sydney, working a part-time warehouse job to help pay bills, and just moved into a shared accommodation. Things weren't always this difficult. I had a girlfriend live with me, so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.

But now that I've been single for a year, and trying to make my way through college, things have been rough. I have depleted any savings I once had, and my credit cards are shot. I still have at least another year in college, but seriously need to consider some kind of alternative to make my way through this.

I rarely go out with friends because of my situation. I haven't had a beer in ages, and can't remember the last time I ate 3 square meals in a day. I might only have one meal a day, because I have to consciously ration the food and money I have. I even invested in hair-clippers recently, just so I can save money on haircuts. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past few months now, and putting food on my plate is simply getting more difficult.

It's kind of depressing actually. I never have thought surviving alone would be so hard.

I must admit, I had a little too much pride to think about asking this pizza Reddit before, but long story short... I'm starving. I'm very embarrassed to ask anyone, as I don't want people to know how poor I am. However, if someone could help a brother out, I would forever be in-debt. Its not just about the pizza, its about helping someone in a time its needed most. I would most certainly love to be able to "pay-it-back" to others who need help, when I get back on my feet (if I find my feet at all).



**UPDATE:**

**EDIT: ** Received the Pizza, and it was the most tastiest bloody pizza I have tasted in a long time. **1stGenRex** you are so awesome. Reddit should be proud to have members like you and others who have offered a kindness that literally makes me want to tear up.

Here are some pics. Oh before I forget, **1stGenRex** decided to be extra awesome by spoiling me with a box of [Magnum minis](http://i.imgur.com/0BfhY.jpg) and a pepsi. Here is the evidence that **1stGenRex** is one of the coolest mofo's on Reddit:

Reddit and Random_acts_of_Pizza and **1stGenRex** stay awesome. Real life Karma will be returned for your kindness.

*sniff* ...love you guys...

I'll be sure to keep subscribed so that one day, I can return the kindness onto others. I can't believe you Reddit. You guys are too awesome.
