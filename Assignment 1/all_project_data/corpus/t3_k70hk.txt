Hey everyone, I'm a college student who lives west of Pittsburgh, PA. It's been one of those weeks. I'm sure you have been there before. Today I had to make the unfortunate decision between paying bills and eating. Unfortunately, the bills prevailed. My anxiety shot through the roof today, and I had to leave class early because I was having a panic attack. I figure I could use a hug right now, but a pizza will more than suffice. I'm not expecting much of anything, even some words of kindness and encouragement would be much appreciated. There is some good news to all of this: I recently got hired full time as a programming analyst. Unfortunately I don't start until early next year, so I am stuck in this situation for a while. I will be more than glad to return the favor some day to anyone who decides to help.

Thanks!

I am actually a real person! [Look!](http://s0.i1.picplzthumbs.com/upload/img/98/c9/82/98c9826b27d5b5e8a2a8fb5b36a121755dbde805_wmeg_00001.jpg)
