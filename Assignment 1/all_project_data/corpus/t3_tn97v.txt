I'm just getting out of a three day gaming comma with the Uncharted Series. The game was so good I couldn't put it down. Now that it's over, I'll be making any repairs that need be done in my life and continuing it. Sad to say, this binge wasn't premeditated and I am low-on-funds. I haven't had a real meal in three days.
I not sure how to say this better so: Please buy me some pizza! I'm so damn hungry!
