Apparently central heat is expensive, and I learned the hard way when the MLGW bill emptied my checkings account. I have one meal's worth of ramen left, and I could use a pizza to get me through tomorrow and the day after. I've already notified my parents of the situation, but they live overseas so the remittance will take a few business days.

I live in Memphis, TN.

I will gladly pay you back, or return the favor to someone else in need if you prefer,  by next week when I have some more money :)
