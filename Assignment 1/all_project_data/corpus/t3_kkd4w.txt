She doesn't know about reddit, but this girl has gone through a lot this year with her recent ex's new relationship being based around making her upset. She's studying for the same exams I am but won't come out of her room for study breaks and she's starting to become an insomniac. Every time we meet up she looks a little bit more depressed and lonely...

I'm sure some good hearted redditors will be able to scrape together a few dollars for this wonderful girl to show her that there are wonderful people out there (as she doesn't believe me or her friends).
