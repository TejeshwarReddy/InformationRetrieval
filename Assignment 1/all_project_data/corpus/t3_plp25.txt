hey guys, me and some friends, there is three of us total are all flat broke(all our money goes to rent and basic needs, we just all moved out and in together) but were totally out of food without access to even a grocery store to even try and rack some food, and due to a recent cold snap its been way to cold to panhandle. If anyone could order us a pizza we would be forever in debt.
