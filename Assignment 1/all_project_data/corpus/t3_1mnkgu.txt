I'm a student living in Boston and I've been terribly sick for the last couple of days. Cold stuff, nothing huge but it's made me miss class which is very annoying.

Being feverish and cold-stricken I'd like to turn the radiator on but the landlord insists on not turning the boiler on until late October. This is New England where things get super cold super fast. I am one of those things and the blankets aren't cutting it. :/

Because of the first couple weeks of classes, I haven't had a chance to grocery shop extensively, only buying fruits and cereal and bread what have you. I've now exhausted all of that. Now I'm out of money too, so I can't even get take out.

I do have money put away for college, but my mother back home insists on regulating it for me. She's probably right to do so, however her boyfriend surprised her with a trip to the carribean. Meaning, now I need money from my account, but can't have it transfered because she is away.

Today's just a shit day: I'm sick, I'm cold, and my money is just out of reach.

May I please have a pizza so I can lay on it to stay warm/eat it while sobbing?
