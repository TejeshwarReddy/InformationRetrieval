Hi, my husband is a US Marine stationed in Camp Pendleton, CA. He left yesterday for a month long training op in preparation for his upcoming deployment to Afghanistan. I am 11 weeks pregnant and only have a package of Easy Mac and a can of soup to last until our pay check comes Friday. Anyone willing to help out would be greatly appreciated!!
