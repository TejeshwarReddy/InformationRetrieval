Unfortunately our funding just ran out, and the university does not plan to renew our grants! We're on the verge of a major breakthrough, wherein we deploy a series of nanobots into the patient's blood stream which seek out and destroy cancer cells! The nanobots run on pizza, but we're out! We're stationed at Western Michigan University! Please, the future of mankind could be in your hands!

[Just to be upfront, we're just really hungry and could use a pizza. But so could our nanobots.]
