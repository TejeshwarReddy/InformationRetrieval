Hey guys. I hate asking for things, but if someone feels like helping a fellow Minnesotan, or a fellow musician, or just wants to be kind to a new member me and my stomach would be infinitely grateful. It hurts to be so hungry.... ONE pizza would probably get me through a week. Been applying for jobs for over a month, still no calls... I've been wanting to go out and apply for some more today, but I'm just so tired and it's hard to even get off the couch without enough energy. Just learned about this site and I think it's a beautiful thing that's happening here. I will surely donate a pizza someday when I have the means. I live in Maplewood, MN... my address can be given if someone would like to get me something. :) Have a good day everyone.
