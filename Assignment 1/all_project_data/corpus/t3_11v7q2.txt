I guess I posted in the "wrong" RAOP...? I don't know... 

Either way, just having another rough day, completely broke, somewhat sick (so staving off any doctor visit, no insurance of course), behind on most bills... I'm looking at being caught up within the next two weeks, but today, pizza would soothe my rumbling tummy.


Let me know!
