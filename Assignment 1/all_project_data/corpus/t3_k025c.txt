[EDIT] I live in Mesa, AZ 85201 &lt;- thanks to [alliOops](http://www.reddit.com/user/alliOops) for the heads up!

I know there are guys worse off than me, so for what I have I am grateful. I have food, just haven't had pizza in too damn long...

So, here's where I'm at:
I got fired because my boss found out I disproved of his business ethics, and then denied my unemployment. I have $3 to my name, and if I had $5 I'd get a Little Ceaser's pizza.

I don't care if it's just cheese or what - I'm not picky. Would just love some pizza right about now. I could go on about more crap-stuff in my life, but I don't like thinking about it.
