Hey y'all, I'm down to less than a dollar until Friday's check and noodles taste only so good after ten packages of them. Would someone be willing to ship me a basic pepperoni? I'm willing to trade pictures of me doing amusing things that don't involve any orifices and intend to return the gift of pizza in the future!
