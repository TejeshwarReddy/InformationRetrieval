My girlfriend was over for a visit here in Germany for the last two weeks (left yesterday) and for some dumb reason spent a bit too much money and now can not afford food for today nor tomorrow untill I can get some cash back.

Would love to get a random pizza sometime this week and I can give back when I get back on my feet money wise
