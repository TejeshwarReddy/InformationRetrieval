**Edit:**  I received a gift card from a fellow redditor.  Thank you so much for the generosity!  I will definitely pay it forward when I get a chance.

I was out of state for a semester of school and returned a few weeks ago.  I was finally offered a job on Friday but I still have to wait for background checks to go through before I can officially start next week (or so).

I'm babysitting my nieces for my brother who happens to work at a dealership across from my apartment so any food will go towards feeding the girls and my brother as well.  My brother is also trying to get back on his feet as well after a divorce so he is unable to pay me for watching the kids.

Now, after that sob story, I will say we are not DYING for food.  If you find someone else in greater need, by all means help them first.  Food would greatly help me save money until I officially start my job, considering I still have to wait another 2-3 weeks for a paycheck to come in.  If I do receive any food, I definitely plan to pay it forward once I am more financially stable.  

This turned out a whole lot longer than I planned.  I would appreciate any help. Thanks!
