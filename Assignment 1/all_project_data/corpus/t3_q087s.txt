Haven't had a real meal for the past 3 days paying off all my bills and having just enough for next month rent.  I'm jobless right now and constantly applying for jobs.  Reason why I moved out here was because I wanted to prove to my parents I could live without their help.  I must say it's been hard but I'm learning a lot about myself here.  For instance, being humble and learning to hustle everyday looking for a job.  I also realized that my parents must have worked their asses off to raise me and my older brother.  It's hard enough taking care of myself.  But yeah, I could definitely use a pizza from domino's and once I get my job, I will never forget this gratuitous act and I am going to offer a pizza on RAOP to another who else is in need.  Thanks for reading!
