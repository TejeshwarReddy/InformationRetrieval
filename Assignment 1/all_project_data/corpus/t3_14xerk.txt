I know I haven't been very active on this site, but I thought I'd give this a shot. I've been out of steady work for about a year now, and this is the first time in 8 years I won't be able to go home for Christmas. I miss my family, miss my friends, miss my steady paycheck, and tonight I'm just plain hungry. Whether this pans out or not, I intend to fulfill another Redditor's request as soon as financially feasible.
