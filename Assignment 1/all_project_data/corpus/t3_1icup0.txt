Times have been tough lately, I'll spare the details, but there is a few other posts I have made in r/assistance and r/loans recently.

Long story short, I'm getting pretty sick of eating ramen and will continue to do so for about 2 more weeks, because, well, that's all I have.  I will gladly pay-it-forward in about a month or so.

Thanks for reading.
