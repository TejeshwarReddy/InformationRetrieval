Hi all,

My fiance dreads his birthday. I was really excited to make it the best birthday I could. Unfortunately, the cards did not fall that way. Recently we've been going paycheck to paycheck with the little we have over going to food, and lawyers fees (custody battle). I was saving a little aside for his birthday, but unfortunately since I work on commission, it didn't come through the past two weeks. I only had money to pay bills and rent.

I was hoping anyone that had a spare moment and some cash could help me buy a pizza for him this afternoon. We can even consider it a loan. I will pay you back. 

Thanks for listening.
