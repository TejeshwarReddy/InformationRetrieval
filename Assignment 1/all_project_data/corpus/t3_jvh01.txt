Hey, 

I'm new to this so I really don't know if I'm doing this right. I live in Atlanta, GA 30305. I just moved out on my own for the first time in July and during the 3rd week of July I lost my job. I have rent coming up next week and my first check from my new job is expected then. But I'm hungry now. I don't have enough food to last me til then. I'm just trying to learn how to survive on my own. So if anyone can help I will appreciate you til the end of time!!! When it comes to pizza i'm not picky especially not at this point.
