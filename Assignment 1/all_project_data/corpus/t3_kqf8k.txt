Hello, I am making this post because my friends and I are currently being held hostage by a pizza troll in Kalamazoo, MI. The pizza troll demands we provide him pizza or else we can not leave. Unfortunately we have no money, please save us from our pizza troll and next time we can save you! (We are really hungry and have no money right now, if you could help us out that would be really wonderful and we will pass the favor along when we can.)
