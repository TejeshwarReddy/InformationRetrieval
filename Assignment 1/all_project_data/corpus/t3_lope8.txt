Hello, we dropped everthing on 10/20/11 and used my unemployment check to drive 18 hours to help her. We left 2 kids and a dog home and brought the youngest with us. We did bring 2 hamburger and lots of boxed Mac and cheese and potatos, we have used up the small amount of money we had, and the next check, well that will be paying for car insurance, and then I hope the 3rd check will put gas in car to go home.  And we could really use  a hot and cheeseie pizza!! It would be AWESOME !!!   We r in Wilmington Deleware. And when I get back home to fl and get back on track I will defenatly pay it forward!
