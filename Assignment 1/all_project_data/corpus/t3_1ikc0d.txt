My boyfriend and I are on pretty tight times at the moment, and have basically been living off hot dogs and Ramen for a bit now. I personally would like to make the food I have last as long as possible, and I'd love to surprise him with something good, since he just found out his hours have been cut. Anything would be appreciated, but if you're feeling super nice, his favorite is Papa Johns!
