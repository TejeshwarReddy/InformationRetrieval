I've been extremely frustrated lately not having any luck finding a job, I'm sure a lot of you know the feeling.  Getting no responses whatsoever is so discouraging.  It would be so awesome to have something other than soup or ramen, but alas I have about 90 cents to my name.  If you aren't able to help me out, but know of any job opportunities within Phoenix, AZ, please let me know!
