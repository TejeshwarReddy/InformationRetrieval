Just started my first semester of college after living on my own for the fall, and man, have I gotten some perspective. I have money in the bank but no atm card (and it's sunday, oops) - had to borrow money yesterday for the first time since moving out, but I spent it on other necessities. Wasn't thinking about food for the rest of the weekend. :(
Anyway, I'm going to be moving back in with my parents within the next few weeks, at which point I'll have much less financial obligation and would love to participate in a Random Act of Pizza. :)
If this reaches anybody willing to help out, I'd be much obliged. If not, I'll see you guys around... keep up the great work!
