Hello reddit

A friend of mine showed me this website the other day and today he told me that one of you might be able to help me with my dilemma.

Apparently I accumulated enough points in Papa John's to get a free pizza, but I sadly don't have the cash to pay for the delivery free, tip and taxes that are involved with the order.

Can one of you guys help me out with this?

Thanks and keep rocking people with pizza!
