hello thank you for taking time to read my post, my name is stephanie and i live with my fiance and our 2 dogs. We do have our own place but are back on rent 5mths and about to be evicted. we both lost our jobs because we only had one car and the tires were really bad so cpl mths ago when it was raining an we wrecked totaling the car. its just been a really hard cpl of mths and with no food or money a pizza would be great. and we would also share a piece with our dogs who to us are our kids. we live in Bedford PA-814-623-9913
