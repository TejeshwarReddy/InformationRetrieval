I've has been going through a bit of a rough patch financially and my cupboards looking pretty empty. Used all of of my savings to pay for my school for next semester. Thankfully, I'm going to be starting a new job tomorrow, but it'll be a while until my first check comes around. I think a pizza would really make things look a little brighter around here and be an awesome change from my oatmeal diet! I'll definitely try to return the favor come paycheck time.
