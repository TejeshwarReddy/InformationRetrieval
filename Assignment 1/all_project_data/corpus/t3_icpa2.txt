Hello, I am a college student studying electricity. I am 26, and recently quit my job to continue my education. I am a veteran and recieve the GI Bill, which is great, but I have stretched it a bit too far this month with the housing stipend. So, for the past few days I have been eating noodles and bread and A1 sauce. Any offers for pizza will not be unappreciated, though, I only request one. The 1st of July I hope to get a direct deposit. Please PM me for details, and I apologize for the novelty account. I have comments that I have made in the past that I would rather not be public domain.
