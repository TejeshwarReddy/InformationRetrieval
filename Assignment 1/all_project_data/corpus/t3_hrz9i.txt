I'm unemployed, single, I lost my cat two months ago and I'm broke. I'm very skinny and have trouble keeping weight on. I have a few job interviews next week and it would be *so* nice to be gifted a lovely surprise pizza and of course I will be gifting pizza to whoever I can when I can. Otherwise, I'll have to pop in on my Nana for some biscuits or something.
