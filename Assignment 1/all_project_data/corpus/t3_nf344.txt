Hello everyone. Recently I have been struggling to get by, I had about £20 to my name. I decided to sell a ton of my stuff on Amazon to raise money for Christmas presents. So I managed to sell £350 worth of stuff (pretty much everything I had of value), but now Amazon says I have to wait til the 29th to cash out. So, I have no stuff, no money to buy Christmas presents, and I've used the £20 I had to my name for postage. My friend told me about this site and how there are some wonderful people out there who will buy pizza for needy people. I have never really thought of myself as needy, but at this time, I am ashamed to say I am. I hardly slept last night as I was so hungry, I have been relying on a packet of lollipops that I bought for 4p, which I actually picked up as I was walking through the town centre - oh the shame! :( I have a very small family, and they all live 2 1/2 hours away on the train, so it looks like I'm stuck til I get paid on the 6th January. If I have any spare money after I get paid, I'll certainly buy another person a pizza.

I am from the UK, but I'm sure if you're not from the UK it would be possible to get a pizza to me. I know this may seem like a lie because I have just registered, but really, I have never been on this site before, and I can provide proof of my bank balance, my packet of lollipops, etc if needed. Hopefully it won't come to that.

I'd like to give my sincere thanks in advance to anyone who comes forward and fulfills my request.
