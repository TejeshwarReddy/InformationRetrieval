My husband and I are expecting our first baby after struggling to conceive. Yesterday we had our first ultrasound and it went AMAZING! We heard the heartbeat and it was magical. 

Would just love to not have to cook supper for us and to celebrate a great day with a pizza since it's pouring rain here.
