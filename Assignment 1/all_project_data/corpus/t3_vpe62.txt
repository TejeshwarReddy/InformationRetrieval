Been going through a difficult time financially and don't get my paycheck until Friday. I would be glad to back it back or forward this weekend. I know this is a long shot but me and the kids could use a mood lift. A dinner of dry cereal makes no one a happy camper in this house LOL. Anyway thank you for taking the time to read. Hopefully this works.
