I didn't know a place like this exists! 

I was out sick for 3 days the week before Labour Day. After my manager came back, I was let go at the end of my shift. I was supposed to be paid my last pay(big whopping 7.5 hours of pay) on Friday that just passed, and of course, they didn't pay me and said that'd be another week before I'll get my final check from them. I start at a new job tomorrow but won't be paid until October 4th and that money all goes right into rent. 

I just would love to eat pizza and watch Breaking Bad tonight as if everything was normal.
