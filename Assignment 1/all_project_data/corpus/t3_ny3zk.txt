My boyfriend (fellow redditor) and I don't have much beyond rice and peanut butter sandwiches (LIVING THE DREAM.) and won't get money for about a week. 

If you get us a pizza, I'll make you a drawing of whatever you like! I have a gallery here, you can choose whether it's worth much. http://auto-de-filet.deviantart.com/
