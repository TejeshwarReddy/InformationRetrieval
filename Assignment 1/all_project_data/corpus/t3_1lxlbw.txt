and I couldn't be happier! I'm so thankful to be employed. It's at a distribution center and I was always the type of girl to work in an office. Not any more, I love it! My dad (who literally has 2 dollars in his pocket) and I are here alone while my mom is away and would love a pizza to share. I will happily pay it forward once I start getting my first paychecks! Thank you!
