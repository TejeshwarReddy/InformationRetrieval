I've never been pizza'd before, so someone will need to tell me how this works. I can get to any of the big 3, but I and my wife prefer the Hut.

In a couple weeks, I'll pizza someone else. Again, I've never done this so someone will need to tell me how to pizza someone else.

Whether I get a pizza or not,  I'll still likely pizza someone in the coming weeks.

Thanks guys!!
