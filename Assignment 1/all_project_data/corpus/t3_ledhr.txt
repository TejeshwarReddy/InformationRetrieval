Ok so my name is Alex or Axeltoss, I am a starcraft 2 caster and am currently at MLG Orlando with Steven Bonnell, a popular starcraft 2 personality... (ROOTDestiny, QxGDestiny).


Steven did a charity drive a while back where he raised over $30,000 with a friend but as a result his paypal was frozen so he can't buy anything. Proof of that is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe2pI21GCic


I've spent a lot of my own money on both of us this weekend because of this fact, and I've been spending way too much. I was hoping someone out there could send us a pizza or two.
Here is proof of us existing:
