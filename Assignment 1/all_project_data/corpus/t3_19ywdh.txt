I've been living on starvation rations for a week; I was determined to treat myself to pizza for my birthday but the friend who owes me money let me down again... 

Any kind-hearted redditors out there wanna give me a present? Much love and virtual hugs will be dispatched via the tubes.

Swindon, UK

EDIT: It is no longer my birthday so I humbly withdraw my request. Thankyou anyway RAoP.
