My car didn't JUST break down, it's getting repaired at the shop, haven't had it for 3 days. haven't been able to get groceries and me and my fiance cleared everything out quicker than expected. We knew we would be riding it slim this month due to the car repair, so we figured we'd give this a shot! Pics, signs, etc available uppon request ;)!
Also, we'll happily return the favor to RAOP within 7 days !

Forgot to add - Orlando, Florida is the area, zip 32839.
