I tried everything before coming here, and I still feel bad for doing this, but I came here to beg for food. I'm a (forgive the clich√©) poor college student. Every food service location on campus is closed (and even so, I only have $3 left for food), and I have no money in my bank account. I really just need something to eat before I head home in the morning. I can't really offer anything, but what I can do is promise to pay it forward.

**TL;DR:** I really just need one more meal before tomorrow.  I'll certainly pay it forward ASAP.

Thank you for your generosity!
