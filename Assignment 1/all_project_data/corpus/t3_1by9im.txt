Just three Southern Illinois University Carbondale students who are hungry! :) I took my girlfriend to the casino and then Olive Garden yesterday for her 21st and turns out I need to brush up on my Basic Strategy. Have a buddy over who is feeling blue and wish to feed him, but dont want to take the hit to the bank account.  A couple of pizzas and a 2-liter should accomplish that! 

Thanks for reading!

**EDIT**: Ended up grabbing something else to eat tonight, but thanks for the upvotes! You stay classy, RAOP.
