My mom's disabled and I lost my job about 2 months ago now.  We live from my unemployment check at the moment. I'm very grateful to even get that much, but it doesn't go very far.  I'm job hunting like a mad man right now but no luck.  A pizza right now would seriously lift our spirits, it's been a hard few weeks and a few canned veggies to munch on until my next check a few days away is hard going.

I'll do whatever is needed to verify whatever you want.  Not sure I could stand on my head and take a pic or anything like that, not very physically fit. &lt;3

EDIT:  Pizza is here!! Thank you so much again!! http://imgur.com/A4z8I
