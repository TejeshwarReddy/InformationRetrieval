First off - I will **not** *starve* between now and Friday, so if you'd rather help someone who has absolutely nothing, I understand, appreciate your stance, and thank you for helping someone truly in need.  

I've been unemployed for better than two years. During that time, I watched most of my photography clients (I did a lot of corporate work) shut down their budgets for expenditures like me. As that income dwindled, I began looking for other work. I'm not sure how much the year-long gap of "employment" (other than self-employed) has mattered, but I haven't been able to find anything. About a week and a half ago I finally got to the point I had to take a laborer job that's physically killing me (ok, it's only very painful). So I'll have something coming my way soon.  

In the mean time, I have a 1/2 sack of potatoes, a few cans of corn, 1/2 jar of peanut butter, 3/4 loaf of bread, and a few boxes of mac and cheese. All of which is pretty much what I've been eating for the past couple of weeks. Like I said, I won't starve, but I damn sure don't have a meal I'm actually looking forward to for the next week.  

It's just me. My dog passed the day after Easter, and as much as I'd love another pet, I know I'm not in a position financially to take on another right now. So even a medium pizza would be like 4 meals - I could take a couple of slices to work every other day for lunch or something just to break the monotony of what I've been having.  

I'm not hiding behind a new account - I am who I am. A quick look at my profile will tell you exactly who I am, and hopefully give you a sense that I try to contribute to the community as well when I can (/r/TOMT, /r/picrequest, gift exchanges, postcards to kids/random people/etc., general blathering). You'll also see where I've sold some of my camera gear to a fellow redditor because I needed the money. I feel bad asking when it's not a matter of "need it or I'll die", but I figure if I'm just honest about where I am, someone might throw me a ~~bone~~ pizza in the spirit of the *Random Acts* part of the subreddit.  

Either way, if you're still reading, you're a good person for even considering helping someone out. Thanks for being part of what makes reddit awesome.
