STILL waiting for my unemployment check and my daughter has officially called a strike on ramen and (surprisingly) Mac and Cheese.  I have already had to get TP in unconventional ways today. All I would like is a pizza to help relax and put a smile on the little brats face for once this week. 

If anyone can throw one our way I would appreciate it. Once I get my check I will return the favor to this subreddit! (hopefully in the next century)

EDIT: I just realized there was a verification process. I did take a picture with my daughter holding my user name.

Thanks so much!
