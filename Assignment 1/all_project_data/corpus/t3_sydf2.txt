I missed two weeks of work earlier this month due to an episode of depresion, and now the bills are looming so money's tight. Been living off cups of ramen and bowls of pasta to cut down on food costs, but a pizza craving is hitting me hard today. I'd appreciate it, and pay it back (or forward!) when I get some money to myself.
