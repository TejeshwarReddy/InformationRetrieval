On Friday night, there I was sitting in my pajamas, eating ice cream when I get a text from a couple friends asking me to come out for wings and a drink with them. I agree and get ready quickly. We get there, order our drinks and food, chatting and everything. We get our drinks and are waiting for our food. Now, we were sitting in a booth and I had my back to the window and I was sitting on the outside. Soooo...all the sudden a car crashes through the building in reverse, pinning me between the booth and the table. I was the only person injured. Within about 24 hours of that all happening, my already insane mother disowns me and encourages me to kill myself (unrelated to the accident) even after I had just had a near death experience. I am now taking a bit of time off work, which I can't afford to do. 


So anyway there's a fun story for you, reddit. I would just love to be pizza'd today.
