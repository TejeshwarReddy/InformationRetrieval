Hey all,

This is my first time using this and honestly I feel a bit guilty for even requesting after reading some of the stories on here.. Some of you guys are much worse off than I and my heart goes out to you. :(

Nevertheless, this has been the week from hell. I'm sick with the flu, I have an (also sick) 5 month old, lots of exams due, and $5.98 in my bank account (yes, I can take a screen shot and show you if you'd like). I've been too sick (and little one is too sick to be taking to the grocery store!) and too poor to even get adult groceries for myself in a couple of weeks, (but we still have a healthy supply of yummies for the little one, so no worries there! Little ones always come first! &lt;3)

Honestly, I'm just sick, broke, worn out and hungry. I'd be happy to repay the favor. I love helping people out :) So if anyone could find it in their heart to help me out with a pizza or two (yay for maybe having cold pizza breakfast tomorrow too!) I'd be the happiest little camper ever. 

&lt;3's!
