I've been out of work and I finally just got a job. A friend I know who works at 7-11 gave me a application today to fill out and turn in tomorrow for a job and I would be extremely grateful if I could eat well tonight (it's been a while) I figured this was the place to post! Much love and I appreciate what everyone does here. I lurk a lot but reading here usually makes my day! Thanks for reading.
