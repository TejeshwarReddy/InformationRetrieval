My suit's pressed, I've spent the last two days researching and memorizing everything I can about the place, I even googled tips for acing an interview. I'm really pumped and I think I'm ready to nail this... the only problem is that I haven't eaten in three days, and I haven't had a good meal for longer than that. My arms are shaking, I can hardly walk without my heart beating furiously, and I just noticed that my voice shakes as well. If I show up to an interview like this I' afraid they'll think I'm a crackhead (I'm pretty skinny). The last substantial thing I ate was a sample of a sandwich from Jimmy Johns, (I asked for three and gave the other two to the homeless people I'd passed a block before) that was on Wednesday.

I just need some sustenance, whether it be a pizza, sammich... shoo I'd be excited about a bag of breadsticks.

If anyone is gracious enough to help me out, I promise to return the favor and help people out on RAOP as soon as financially possible.

Thanks for your time!
