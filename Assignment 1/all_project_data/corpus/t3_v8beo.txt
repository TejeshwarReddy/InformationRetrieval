[Pizza received]

Thanks Llamacat21!!

We've also got a broken down vehicle we are needing to pay for and zero food in the house. We're tired of shoving random crap in stale tortillas and are just looking for some decent food. Please help feed us. My girlfriend's an artist and I'm sure she'd be willing to draw up a decent thank you!
