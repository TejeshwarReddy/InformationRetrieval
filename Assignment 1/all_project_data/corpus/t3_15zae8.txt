I don't get paid until next week and my parents left me little food to work with before they left on vacation. I've been eating eggs nearly everyday since thats all there really is to cook in my kitchen. They come back on Sunday and I'm all out of eggs. It's been a depressing 3 weeks and a pizza is all I'm craving to celebrate surviving on eggs this whole time.
