EDIT! fireflygirlie hooked it up! Thanks so so so much!


My boyfriend and I just broke up a few days ago. I'll try to keep it short because it's complicated and dramatic, but I'm heart-broken. I did pretty well the first few days, but it's finally setting in and I'm at a loss. I never saw this happening and I don't know what to do with myself. I'm trying to cheer up by watching reruns of Arrested Development. Since I'm paying 100% of the bills (another dilemma I'm attempting to work out), I'm flat broke. If there's a kind soul out there that could feed me some cheesy love, that'd be great. 

I'm using a throwaway because I have some IRL friends that use Reddit and I'm a little embarrassed. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
