I know, no one likes a sob story, but any offers would be appreciated by us. [Here's a picture of our dogs expressing gratitude.](http://i.imgur.com/YdimK.jpg) I followed all the instructions on the side bar so, I guess I'm verified.

I don't know if this helps but I haven't put on any clothes yet (been applying for jobs *online* all morning), and my wife says "do you think being nude asking for pizza will make you more successful?" what do you think reddit? will it? (i hope it doesn't do the opposite.)

Edit: I'm located in Southern California. I just saw the reminder to include location, i missed that.

Edit #2: Pizza has been received! thank you rorrim180! i was naked up until about 15 minutes before the pie arrived. i think it worked.
