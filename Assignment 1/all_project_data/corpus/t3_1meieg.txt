I'm a music teacher who also teaches private lessons.  I just got home from lessons today and I'm spent.  I don't have the energy to cook dinner and decided I'd be willing to write an original song on the topic of your choice and record it for you.  The instrumentation will be guitar and voice.

History is filled with musicians and benefactors.  Haydn had the Esterhazy family, Mozart had the Archbishop of Salzburg, Bach had the Duke of Saxeweimar (who threw him in jail).  I could have you (for a much cheaper price I might add).

Seriously, any topic you want.  You want a song, I want a pizza.  Let's make this happen.
