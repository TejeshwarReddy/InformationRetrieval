Hi Reddit! I never thought I'd be posting one of these. Here's my story. I came down to visit my girlfriend Thursday night. Everything was going good until this morning. We got in a huge fight and she gave me the boot. Where I live is an approx. 45 minute drive. 
I pretty much feel like a bum, but I don't know what else to do. I'm at a public library using the computer with a visitor's pass. I've only got 45 min left. Surprise me Reddit, please!

Edit: I've figured out where I'm staying tonight. I'll be off and on all night checking this, hoping this works out.
