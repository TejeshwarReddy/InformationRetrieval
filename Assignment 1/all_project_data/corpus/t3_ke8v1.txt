A little about me: I am in a supportive living program for chemical dependency after completing a rigorous in-patient detox program. Myself and three other guys share an apartment and we get all of our food from the facilities 'food pantry.' We aren't starving but I know I haven't enjoyed the tasty goodness of a pizza in over 41 days! One of the other guys has been deprived for nearly 90 days! I will do whatever is necessary to substantiate my story if need be. Thanks for taking the time to check this out.
