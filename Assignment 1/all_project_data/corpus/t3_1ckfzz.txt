With Boston and all I'm pretty much on the bottom of the food chain but I'm at the point where I'm returning bottles to make Bus fare to get to work. Working while starving is killing my performance to point people are noticing and the spiral downward is starting. I'd have pawned the machine I'm typing on if could have found a shop that would take it. I'm getting paid soon and I'll be sending out pizza as soon as I can. I'm in upstate NY.
