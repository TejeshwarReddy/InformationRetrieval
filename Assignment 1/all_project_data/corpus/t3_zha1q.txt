I'm posting from a throwaway. Let me give you a run through of my typical day: I wake up, take a shower/get dressed, and head to hell. I work in a call center in a little cubicle where my only joy is seeing the clock hit 7pm. I sit in a chair and get yelled at for 8 hours. Sometimes 16 hours, because my boss likes to tell me that his star agent has taken off and he needs me to cover their shift. This rockstar agent also likes to come in late and is related to the head manager so..why would I complain about him? Who would I complain to? He's a pain in my ass always asking me questions that he should know the answer to. 

My other co-workers are really good people and by good I mean aholes. One guy plays erotic games most of his shift on the company computer and no one seems to care. Another lady is a busy body Christian looking to convert everyone and anyone she can find. If she spent more time working versus running around telling everyone to have a blessed day, she'd get more accomplished. The other co-workers pretty much annoy the living shit out of me. They call me and ask for answers or blind transfer callers to me. 

I know I need out of this job and I complain way more than I should. I should be happy I have a job. I should be happy I can barely afford my bills. Right right? Wrong! I've been looking everywhere else for work, but not many places are hiring near me. I'm so depressed with everything. My only motivation to go into work is for the check.

I'm hoping someone who has worked in customer service hell knows my pain and would be willing to treat me to some cheesy noms tonight. I will **absolutely** pizza it forward on pay day. I'm willing to provide a copy of my paystub and will send you a message from my main account if needed. I am really a broken man and I have completely lost my faith in everyone. 

Thank you for reading and I'm sorry this was too long winded.
