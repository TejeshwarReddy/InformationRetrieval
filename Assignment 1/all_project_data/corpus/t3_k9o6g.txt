I've been having a really difficult time getting on my feet. I was hit by a serious and ongoing neurological problem a couple of months ago, which has made it even harder to find work. I'm all alone in my crappy apartment, my family is hundreds of miles away and so is my girlfriend. I've never tried this before, but it would be great if I could get a big, greasy, sausage mushroom pizza. It's past 12:00 in NY, I wonder if anyone still even delivers...?

This is a really cool subreddit idea, by the way.
