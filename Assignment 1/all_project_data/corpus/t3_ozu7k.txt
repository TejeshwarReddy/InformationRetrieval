Alright, I returned home yesterday -- after spending the previous few days with my boyfriend -- to discover my apartment had been... burglarized (not robbed but burglarized -- police helpfully explained distinction) of the following junk:

- PS3
- PS2
- assortment of games for both
- coffee table
- my crappy CRT TV

*Thankfully* I'd taken my laptop over to boyfriend's for some LAN partying.

I've never posted to RAoP before, and my account's (very) new, so I apologize for my lack of street cred -- though I've been lurking for months and months. =D

Anyway, reddit, a pizza for me would be like the Holy Grail at this point. I don't... exactly know how this works, but if anyone's willing to help and/or wants any further info, I'll happily happily oblige. Thank you! &lt;3
