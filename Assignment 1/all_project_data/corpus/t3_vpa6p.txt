Hey guys, my friend just told me about this and I'm starving and don't know when I'll have money or food again. I just started working and all my last check went to bills and gas to get to work. I'm a type I diabetic who's in some need of food, and a pizza would be amazing right now.

I'm willing to play some Team Fortress, Killing Floor, or anything else (as long as I have the game lol) w/ anyone who helps!

Thanks in advance!
=)
