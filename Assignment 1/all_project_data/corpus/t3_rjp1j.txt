So I have never done this before, but i'm pretty desperate.  I am at school today with no money until tomorrow.  I have class in like 2 hours and i need to eat something.  I haven't had anything all day unfortunately.  there was nothing at my apartment to eat when I left for school either.  If there is anyone on here who can help, i will promise to return the favor to someone else in need.  thanks again for reading this, and hopefully helping me out. :)
