Hellooo Redditors. I'm 22 years old and on my own for the first time, thousands and thousands miles away from anyone related to me, and my dog. I just got a new job, work 70 hours a week, make close to no money, and never have time to eat. Being so far from my family for the first time kinda blows, but I'm also proud to be doing it!

Pizza. Pizza is all I want. I just moved from a tiny town in Maine, where the closest real pizza was about 2 hours away. Besides craving pizza, I crave a filling meal, as I don't have the money or time to eat. (Rare day off)

EDIT: Totally forgot to put in that I live in Marietta, GA
