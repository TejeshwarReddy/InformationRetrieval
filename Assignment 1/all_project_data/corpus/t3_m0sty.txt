November is notorious for "no-shave" or "no-whatever" 30 day fasting, but this is crossing the line! We have bonded over so many things via pizza, it is one of the major cornerstones of our friendship. I have already fought several long battles with her over this- how dare she leave me in the trenches alone! She will be home from work in about an hour and a half to two hours. This is my final stand against no-pizza-november, she won't listen to my reasoning any longer - Reddit help me out and be the calvary!

EDIT: SUCCESSSSSSSSS!! Thanks to TheSheepdog she finally caved in!! "Last one for the month.." Psh yeah right. She knows she loves this bonding session way too much, haha. [Here are some pics!](http://imgur.com/a/t9Yr7#0) Don't let her fake sad face fool you, she loved every bite :)
