So here's the scoop â€” I have a few ingredients from which I might be able to pull together a meal. However, I am working on deadline right now trying to get a business off the ground. I'm hungry as hell but I don't have time to get creative in the kitchen, I'll be working til after midnight at least as it is.

Pizza delivery would solve my time and hunger issues however I won't have any money until tomorrow night (11/27).

Anyone care to spot me a pizza? I can pay it forward (or back) in about a week if you wish. (Possibly as long as 2 weeks, but probably not that long)

I'm a longtime redditor, this is my regular Reddit account, I have a spankin' new verification code, and I have a record of repayment over at r/assistance though I only asked there once.

If you spot me a pizza, I'll sing a song for you and post a link to the mp3! (After deadline which means, tomorrow night)
