After spending two and a half months unemployed, the universe seemed to have the BEST sense of humour, and I landed three interviews today (two face-to-face, one over the phone). I absolutely NAILED them, and feeling like next week I'm going to have jobs fighting over me. (Longer success story [here.](http://redd.it/ojvu1)) So I'm feeling pretty damn good. But you know what would make me fly on absolute Cloud 9 right now? A good ol' pizza!

First time asking.
