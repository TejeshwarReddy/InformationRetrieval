Hi, everyone. I'm in college right now and have absolutely no money, and will continue to be broke until I get paid in two weeks. This is my first time posting on RAOP. I'm requesting a pizza not for me, but for my boyfriend. He's absolutely wonderful to me, and right now he's going through a really hard time. His mom is sick. Really sick. And normally in this kind of situation I would make/buy some kind of food for him. Giving food in times of hardship is a kneejerk reaction for me, it's just what I do. But since I can't afford to get him anything at all, I figured I'd give this subreddit a shot. I have no idea what else to do. I'm out of my depth with this. I have no idea what he's going through, so I don't have any idea what to say to make him feel better. But maybe him not having to worry about dinner would help a little bit.

Anyway, thank you for reading this and for your consideration. Sorry I rambled a lot up there.

**EDIT:** Thank you SO FREAKING MUCH, jetboyterp. You are absolutely amazing. I will definitely pay it forward in the future. Thank you!!!!
