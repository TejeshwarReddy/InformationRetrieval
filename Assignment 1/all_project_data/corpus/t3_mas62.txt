I'm a psychology student that is very short on cash, due to an unexpected expense. My mother is on disability and she could not afford her prescriptions. I ended up paying for her prescriptions, which left me very short on cash. I can provide a receipt of the prescriptions for verification, as well as a copy of my bank statement. It was a tough decision to make, but I know I did the right thing. My mother has sacrificed so much in her life for me that I didn't hesitate when she asked me for help. 

I will not get paid again until Wednesday of this week, and one pizza can definitely help me make it until then. I have $2.00 left until pay day. I'm hoping that someone will be able to help me. Thank you.
