I have no sob story, and I do have food here. However Pizza is out of my budget right now and I won't be getting any money until next week and I'd really love a Cheese and Tomato Pizza from Domino's!

The cheapest order for delivery at Domino's is £8.50, which I'd be overjoyed with! Or they are doing an offer for any pizza, any size, for £10

I really like the idea of this community and I'm hoping I can contribute back when I have the funds to do so :)

Thanks very much if you do decide to contribute! **Don't forget I'm in the UK, Kent!**
