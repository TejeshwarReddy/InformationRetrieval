I tried posting on here last night but it doesn't look like my post made it onto the site. Rather than write it all out again I'll sum it up as best I can.

My hubby of nearly ten years spent the money my mother gave us for food on beer and cigarettes, so since last night he's been booted out of the house by yours truly. Not sure when I'll let him back in but I intend to stay mad for quite a while. It got down into the 40's last night so I reckon he's definitely regretting his decision about now.

Thankfully he at least got food for the dog so that's one less thing to worry about, but I don't get paid until Monday and that money was supposed to help us make it to then. Right now my fridge is barren, all I have is half a jar of really old pickles.

I ended up taking the day off work today. I'm hungry, angry, upset, not really good for much of anything. I need something to eat, hopefully something that will last a day or two or three. Monday is quite a ways to go without something in my stomach.
