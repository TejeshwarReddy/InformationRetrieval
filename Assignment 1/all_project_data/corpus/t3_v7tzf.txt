I fell in love with a girl, a seemingly amazing girl, who I was ready to grow old withâ€”for better or worse and everything in between. I'd been hurt before, but I gave her more and more of my trust and grew to love her enough to commit myself to her for life. I had taken her across the country to make sure she could meet all of my family, especially my grandparents while they're still alive. Everything was going great until... well.... She broke up with me rather suddenly. The reasons she gives make it seem like she's hiding something from me. We never had any real problems. The fact is, I hardly feel like getting out of bed in the morning. I still go to work to pay my bills, but I don't really have any friends in my town anymore, and my family lives far away. My roommate is pretty much all I have left around here. Everything around here reminds me of times that I spent with my beloved, but it's all been shattered.

I feel completely devastated. She was my life. I'd love to feel a little bit of the love that you good folks are spreading around if you could share it. I'll get a verification code as necessary. Thank you kindly, fellow Redditors.
