My girlfriend and I are moving out of a bad apartment and it has drained us financially. The work I do is going through a dry spell so I have not gotten paid in a month, and any funds I had left in my account have been put towards transferring services and paying first and last on a new place, as well as paying existing bills.

We haven't had much of a meal in around two weeks and our fridge is empty tonight. A pizza would really help and cheer me up! Thanks a lot for your consideration, RAOP.
