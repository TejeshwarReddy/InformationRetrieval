I've been working for a month now, and only been paid minimally by one of my four jobs. I get paid by another one some time next week, but could use a bit of help. I've run through my savings and I'm in need of something besides ramen! I have a small amount of baht in my pocket, but I need it for gas to get around town to my jobs on my motorbike.

Pizzas in Thailand are only US$4, so a little help would go a long way! 

I'll get you back with legit california style tacos from my kitchen after I get paid! 

Important side note: I'm a cheese eating vegetarian.
