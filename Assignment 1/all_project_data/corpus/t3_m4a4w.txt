I know this is cliche, but I got into a car accident and getting it fixed emptied my account. I need the car to allow me to get to school and work. I am 300$ short on rent and am trying to sell of any non essentials in my apt. I have no food in my apt other than the condiments in my fridge. I hate asking but help would be greatly appreciated, and when i get back on my feet I would be glad to pay back the favor.

Im in San Marcos TX

If you want pics of the car, just ask.
