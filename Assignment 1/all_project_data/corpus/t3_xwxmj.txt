My truck got stolen this morning before work, I had started my truck and had to go back in to grab my cellphone, and when I came back out I saw the taillights of my truck going down the road. Since I had to call off work last week while my daughter had food poisoning, and since I was late today my boss fired me on the spot. And to top it all off the clarinet I had rented for her band class was in my truck, now I owe 600 dollars to the store for it, and I still have to rent her another one. Wednesday has always been pizza night for me and my daughter, I only get her on the weekdays during the summer, and school starts Monday.
