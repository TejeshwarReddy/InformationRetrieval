Hey redditors, 

I saw the article on CNN.com about this place, and figured I'd give it a go. I know that as a new redditor I probably won't get anywhere right off, but I figured I'd give it a try as I'm tired (and nearly out of) of ramen.

Management at my work has cut all of the cashiers' hours down to 25hrs a week. As it is, I barely could afford to pay rent and utilities and get decent food before the cuts... and now, I'm living off of however much ramen I can buy with my paycheck and still keep my bank accounts open, which is not good since my car is still (hopefully) waiting for me to pay off its repair bills.

And to top it all off... I'm currently sleeping on an air mattress, as my regular one is infested with Bedbugs, courtesy of my apartment complex.

This year is not being kind to me so far &gt;.&lt;

For proof... an image of my pantry: http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/6219/photo0074e.jpg

To anyone who helps, a big thank you from the bottom of my heart.
