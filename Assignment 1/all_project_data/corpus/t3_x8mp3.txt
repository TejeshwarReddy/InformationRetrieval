Hi!, I'm from around the GTA in Ontario, Canada- I was recommended by a internet friend that I could maybe receive a pizza here..

My fridge broke down about a week plus ago ( I live in an apartment complex ) 
Anyways, I found this out much later than I should have.. and all my food spoiled.
It's near the end of the month, and I wasn't prepared to face this type of problem..
Only have a $1.46 in my bank account right now, and I'm trying to tide over with a can of beans and an expired bag of popcorn until the 1st of next month hits..

Anyways, thanks for reading my thing; and I hope you have a good day!
