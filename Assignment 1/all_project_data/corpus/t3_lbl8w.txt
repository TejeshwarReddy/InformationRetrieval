I'm a sophomore female at the university of Illinois. I'm a double major in finance and computer science and have been studying in my office cubicle (because it's quiet here at night and the internet is really freaking fast) for a little over 15 hours now. Anyway, I was just taking a quick reddit break, and thought I'd try. I'm really hungry!
