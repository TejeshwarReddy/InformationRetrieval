Just go home from work (started at 4am) and have to do it again tomorrow.  Too exhausted to cook and if I did it would take too long to make and clean up as I need to go to bed soon to get up again for my shift tomorrow.  Help feed me for the week.  Please.  I'll be so grateful and pay it forward when I can.&lt;3
