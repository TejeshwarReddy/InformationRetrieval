I'm not poor in the desperate sense of the term by any means, and I absolutely respect the people that take the kindness of their heart and spread happiness in the life of one person that really can't afford a meal with something as seemingly small as a pizza.
This isn't one of those posts. Truth be told, I have a crush on a girl that I invited over tonight for a simple pizza/movies/maybe a little football evening. While I don't have any cash, I thought I had a credit card handy to cover it, and tonight was the only night she'd be available for another week (student/job), but she's "really excited we could work this out tonight." So was I, until I realized the credit card expired at the end of August and I hadn't gotten my new card yet; likely shipped to my old address in Brooklyn. So on top of no food for the "date" (I'd like to think, also, no groceries due to the no money thing, paycheck doesn't come for a few days) I have no credit card as backup. No purchases for a few days it seems.
I know that most people will read this and laugh at the mishaps of a hapless kid trying to chase a cute girl with poor planning, but I'm hoping that one person will relate to the irrational, and sometimes stupidly blind decisions we make when a pretty girl is excited to spend time with us. She loves chicken and pineapple pizza and I was hoping to come through with a simple surprise to make her smile off the bat.
I can verify I'm a real, sane person at college with a real address that willingly accepts pizza deliveries if you want to be the ultimate wingman/wingwoman. Commit a RAOP.

I'm located in Tallahassee, FL at Florida State University, btw
