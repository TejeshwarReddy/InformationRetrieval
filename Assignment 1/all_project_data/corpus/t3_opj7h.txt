I just found this community and am quite a fan of "paying it forward" surprise kind of things. So I figured I'd give it a try seeing I'm in a rather downtrodden mood as of late considering there has been nothing but bad luck for this girl lately. I wont get into a huge story about it of course. But crappy times usually promote me to seek comfort in some way.

Thanks for reading. And keep me in mind for a giver to anyone near my area.

Good Karma to you all. ^-^
