We're just sitting here near indianapolis on our nights off, wishing we had something other than poptarts to eat tonight. Just pulled a double at work but there is no room in the budget to splurge. Groceries this week consisted of tuna and white bread...and I'm pretty damn tired of tuna at this point. We're pretty nice people so we're hoping karma will help us out! We promise to post a special [thank you] and pay it forward ASAP!!
