I love pizza. I don't have enough money in my bank account to order one. I'm really hungry. I don't have a car, so I can't go get pizza in person. PAPA JOHNS IS FAR AWAY, IN BALTIMORE. 

BALTIMORE. I love Pizza. Pizza is my favorite food. I am alone tonight and PIZZA WOULD BE SO WARM AND LOVING.

If anyone would be so gracious, I would pass down the warm pizza giving when I have available funds. I can also send pictures of the pizza in my hands, mouth, and while I am doing homework.
