I dont like doing this.. the whole asking a stranger for help thing. Ive always been more inclined to give than receive. Unfortunately, here I am with a request.

 I live in a 2 bedroom apartment in Escondido CA. I have been paying rent here by myself for 2 months. Last month I finally found a roommate that seemed so promising. She gave her security deposit of 100 bucks and was planning on moving in tomorrow (june 1st). Two days ago she backed out.. I have 700 bucks in my account and dont get paid for 2 weeks. My rent is $1200. Needless to say I am freaking out. 

I havent been shopping for food for 2 weeks, I have beans and rice left thank god.. Im starting to look like shaggy from scooby doo since I cant afford a hair cut. Im using TP from my work and dandruff shampoo as hand soap. There have been better days.

Look, I have been a RAoP reader for a while and I have always wanted to buy some deserving stranger a pizza. I know that there are people who deserve this more than me. Its kind of depressing having my first post here be a request. But this is my promise, the second I can afford to help others here, I will. The karma will be passed on. Im just at a low point and a simple pizza would really brighten my outlook.. thanks for reading guys. You all rock my socks with the kindness Ive seen here.
