So here I am, I'm jobless and literally have no money to my name. I get Â£80 every 2 weeks from Job Seekers Allowance thanks to water supplier taking a chunk too, also I have to pay all the bills and well having done that I had little money for food and needless to say I have ran out and I am desperate as I don't get paid for a few days.
If someone would be kind enough to help me out I will love them forever and try and repay their kindness as soon as I can.
