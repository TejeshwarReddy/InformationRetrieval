Recently laid off and up on Capitol Hill, have my dog keeping me company for these very depressing last few days. Made a big pot of spaghetti four days ago that I have been reheating to eat for breakfast lunch and dinner while I wait for unemployment to kick in and pizza would be a nice change, I will return the favor once I am on my feet again in a few weeks, there is a Pizza Hut nearby. Anything helps :)
