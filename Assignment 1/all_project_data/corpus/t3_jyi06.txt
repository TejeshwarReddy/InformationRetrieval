Hey reddit,

 My fiance and I recently sold everything we own and bought an rv so that we at least had a place to live. unfortunately that left us with no funds for anything else, and just like a champ our RV broke down. So, we are currently on the side of the road, in front of a friend's house. It would be really awesome to have a pizza to eat ourselves, but I would really like to have something to offer the household. We don't get our food stamps until the 9th, and just though that maybe reddit could come through in a pinch. 

Thanks everyone!


P.S. I'm using my dad's old account so that i wouldn't be on a *new one
