First off, yes this is a new account. I've lurked around various subreddits for some time but I've never felt like I had anything to add. More of a reader than a talker I suppose. Anyways, my children's mother surprised me by dropping the kids off this morning, as she felt going to the lake with a new bf was important enough to warrant me taking a day off of work with no notice. I was supposed to have them this weekend, so I wasn't really prepared grocery wise. (None of this is her concern, but that whole thing is a story for a different subreddit.) If someone would like to make a couple of kids day a little better by giving them something besides ramen and toast, that would be great. I'm not creating this account just for this..I've been meaning to for a while and plan on posting a lot more, as well as paying this forward. Thanks for reading.

UPDATE: Thank you newchel. You're an awesome person.
