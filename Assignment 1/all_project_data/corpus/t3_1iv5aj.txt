*note: I'm not actually desperate.

I realize that making you a song is a small thing, so I'm not going to ask you to send me a large pizza with lots of toppings or anything. Really, the most that I'm asking for is like a small pizza with no toppings. All I ask is that you keep the requests reasonable, and keep in mind that I'm not a millionaire, so I don't have access to a lot of things, such as realistic instruments like electric guitars or vibrant orchestras.

NOTE: I'll PM you my address when I'm completed with your request.
