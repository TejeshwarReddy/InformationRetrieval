So..  without giving you my whole life story here goes -   I have been having health issues that have been progressively worse over the last few years.  (I am getting tested for carcinoma this week)  My girlfriend not only has stayed with me but provides me with everything I need, including expensive pre-existing condition insurance which she had to move across the country for me to have.  I keep trying to work from home and sell my stuff on ebay etc. but I never will equal the amount that she gives without any hesitation.

I have not been able to take this girl out for dinner in 3 years and she works full time.  It would make my lifetime to be able to surprise her with pizza that was acquired by me.

*as a caveat my illness causes me to not be able to eat, consequently I am not excited about food much less cooking it and not eating it so this would save me from that too for a night :)
