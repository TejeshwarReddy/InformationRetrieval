After the past month, maybe its time to finally check this place out.

The great news is I've been at my job now for 3 weeks and pay day is Friday - I'm getting a room! 

Bad news is, I haven't been eating very well at all - for the most part, I've provided for myself, but this week has been lean. Anyone want to help me celebrate my soon to be obtained freedom from this private hell with some delicious delectable discs of cheese, tomato sauce &amp; toppings? 

I'm not expecting anything, won't mind if it goes either way, but I know that I'll be paying it forward this weekend. Also, since I don't have an address -  I wonder if this is even possible

Best wishes RAOP, you're probably the coolest community. 

edit **I would ask that this ticket be considered closed - Tarable, the sweetest person ever has made my night** pics coming soon.
