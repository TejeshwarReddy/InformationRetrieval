Passing of my grandfather. 750 miles driven yesterday. 5 round trips to new york in 3 days from new haven, along with a rushed flight back from europe. Work... Lots of work... Exhaustion... 3 hours of sleep a night at most.. Anyways. Pizza is nice. Writing that out was pretty nice too. Finally have nothing to do. Anyways. If you are even reading this you are probably a pretty great person, so thanks.
