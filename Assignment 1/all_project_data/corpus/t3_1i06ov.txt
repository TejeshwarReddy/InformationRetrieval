This is my first request. I'm a student studying abroad in China, and a recent illness cost me a bit more money than I anticipated. I have over a month left here, and I would really appreciate the help.

You can check my post history for proof of my studies, and I have a verification code. Please let me know if you have any questions, and, if you're able to help, thank you so much.

EDIT: About 45 minutes left to order tonight. I'll update when they're no longer accepting orders, so message me any time before then. I'm really hungry :(

**EDIT 2: Ordering is closed for tonight. Perhaps some other time, though. Thanks, guys.**
