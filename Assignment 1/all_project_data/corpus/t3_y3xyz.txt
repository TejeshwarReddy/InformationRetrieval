My sister and I live in the Fort area of Knoxville, and our shorter summer hours at work have allowed us to pay our bills (rent, medical, etc.) only.  Food is a little bit more difficult to come by because I have Crohn's/cannot eat gluten, but nearby pizza joints have been offering gluten-free options. 
Any help would be so incredibly appreciated. Come next week, we'd love to return to the favor, too. Peace and love to all of you!
