Been out of work for two weeks, but my new job in NYC starts on Monday.  It'll be another two weeks before my first paycheck and it's getting scary putting everything on the credit card.  Pizza sounds awesome on a Saturday... while I sit at home and catch up on some new episodes of adventure time...

Edit: despite our best efforts on an international pizza order, pizza did not come through.  But I want to thank /u/powdered_water for trying so hard, anyway! I'm gonna cook some rice and veggies, tonight, but if somebody wants to buy me a pizza for tomorrow, I'll happily accept! :D
