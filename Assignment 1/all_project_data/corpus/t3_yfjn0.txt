So the other day, a pack of flaming rabid monkeys entered my house and asked politely for a sandwich. They were too adorable, setting my house on fire and all, so I gave them a turkey sandwich. Right at that moment, my bank waddled in the door in a penguin costume and yelled, "Stop right there! You're now in debt one turkey sandwich!" I cried and cried; I was completely out of turkey sandwiches. I asked him if there was anything else I could do, and he said I could give him a pizza. So please, someone help me out here.

Also, to those who are thinking 'what an idiot', [check this out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/j7naj/just_something_id_like_to_get_off_my_chest/)
