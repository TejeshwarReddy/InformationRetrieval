Location: Chicago

I'm a bit under the weather, and after having worked an 8 hour shift starting at 4:30am yesterday, my sleep schedule is a tad fucked. So I'm wide awake at one in the morning. 

And I would adore a delivery of any hot food right about now. There's only so much canned split pea soup that one person can consume.

Love and luck to all my fellow service industry workers on St. Paddy's day weekend!
