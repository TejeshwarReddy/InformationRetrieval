so i recently moved to cookeville tn and was going to get an apartment with a friend, but my wallet got stolen somewhere and now im out of over 600$ my ss card, id and my debit card. I have a job lined up with mentioned friend but I'm unable to start working until they have my id/ ss card ect. I would be really grateful if someone could provide a bit of food for me today,  the last time i was able to get anything was around friday(around lunchtime) any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
