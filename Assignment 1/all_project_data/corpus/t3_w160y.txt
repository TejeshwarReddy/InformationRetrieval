If a pizza were to show up at around 11pm at 606 Catherine St., Ann Arbor, MI 48104 a new 4th of july national hero would be born! You'd make independence day for 3 friends that much more awesome!

edit: reward - an imgur album of the us 3 enjoying the pizza, and doing whatever the hero desires or anonymously writes on the box via special instructions, as well as some awesome real life karma
