Hey Pizza people, I've just finished making sure that my neighborhood is ready for the upcoming hurricane, but in doing so, I had to spend my paycheck on supplies and such, so I'm looking for the kindness of one person to send a pizza and I'll be eternally grateful and I'll repay it back later. :)

Much thanks and here's hoping everything will work out!
