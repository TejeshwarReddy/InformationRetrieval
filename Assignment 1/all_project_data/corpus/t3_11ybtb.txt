We walk thru the woods in search of werewolves. 
We walk thru the woods at night. 
We aren't afraid of them at all, 
unless they try to bite!

Alas our pockets be empty
And we're quite in need of a munch
But if you'd send us a pizza,
We'll gladly eat it for lunch!

(Thanks for your consideration, any pizza store would do)
