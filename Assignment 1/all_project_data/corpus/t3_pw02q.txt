I've had the occasional gout attack but the ones this week have taken the cake. Have been bedridden and crawling around literally and had an attack in my other foot last night so unable to get around at all. If anyone suffers from guilt you know how hellish and depressing it is. Anyways just posting to see if any kind sympathetic soul would send a pizza over (easy on the meat ; )) since I can even get up and cook. I guess I could crawl to the door. Thanks.
