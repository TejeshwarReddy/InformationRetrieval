A combination of switching jobs and subsequent pay period lag, medical, and other unexpected bills have left finances tight until Tuesday. Pizza for the wife &amp; 2 kids would be an awesome stress relief pick-me-up. If someone would be so kind as to pizza us today, I'll pay it forward x2 when my check clears to two other requests in need of some hot cheesy goodness!
