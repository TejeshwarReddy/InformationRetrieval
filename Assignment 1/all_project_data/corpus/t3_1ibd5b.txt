Hi all.  It's my first time posting here, though I've been a redditor for a few years now.  I wanted to make sure that I didn't post here until I absolutely needed it.

I've been broke all summer.  I've been looking for a job, but so far I've found nothing.  In two weeks my financial aid will come in.  I have an amazing job lined up for fall and winter.  But right now I could really do with some real food.  It's been over a month since I've known where my next meal will come from.

Thank you, good people of Random Acts of Pizza, for truly understanding the value of community :)

Edit:  Wow!  Thank you!  Logicday not only bought me pizza for the night, but also a $100 giftcard at Target so I can support myself these next two weeks.  There are no words.  I am truly grateful.
