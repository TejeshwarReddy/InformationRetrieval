It was the first weekend I've not had to work overtime since July. I forgot my debit card at the bar. It's Sunday so the banks are closed, and my fridge was just replaced so I have no food.

Would anyone be willing to help me out tonight with some food? I remember this subreddit from awhile back and would love to donate some pizza Tuesday for a pizza today :)
