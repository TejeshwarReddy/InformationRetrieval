This is the first time I've gone to RAoP, but I'm kind of in a bad spot.  So I have no electricity to cook anything, and I'm completely broke for the next two days.  Anything at all would help immensly, and I would be more than willing to pay back in any way, shape, or form come Friday.  

Thanks a ton for reading and have a great day!
