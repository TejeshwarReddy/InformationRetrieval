Hey friends!  I just moved to Kansas City three weeks ago and I was recently fired from my job, serving at a movie theatre, but I quickly got a job serving at a local restaurant.  Unfortunately, I have to wait a bit for my paycheck, and I've had -.87 cents in my account since last Saturday.  Just a small cheese pizza would be ridiculously appreciated.
