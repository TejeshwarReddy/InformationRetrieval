I feel absolutely horrible for asking here in light of the tragedy on the East Coast, but I am at my Wit's end. I've literally just had the tv classic "Well, it can't get any worse..." moment, and then literally within 5 minutes Storm clouds moved in and it started pouring down raining, and I am without shelter. 

I was planning on walking downtown to a 24 hour cafe and trying to sort things out there. My only friend in the world is out of town all weekend. A nearby inn is letting me sit in their lobby, for now. 

I was also going to stop by a store to grab a bite to eat (food stamps), but that's not possible anymore with this storm. I could really use a warm pick me up reddit. I'm cold, wet, and starving. 

I will be glad to answer any questions of how I got into this predicament or provide any proof about my situation if you want, don't want to take up space or time.
