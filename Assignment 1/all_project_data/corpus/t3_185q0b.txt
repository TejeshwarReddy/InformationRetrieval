So I started working at a small law firm and I haven't been paid since I started at the beginning of January. I am running low on funds after traveling across Texas (Lubbock to Austin to College Station to Kingwood and back to Lubbock) for an interview and to support my brother's pregnant girlfriend after she received some scary news. Would love to have a pie when I get home tonight. I promise to pay it forward when I can.
