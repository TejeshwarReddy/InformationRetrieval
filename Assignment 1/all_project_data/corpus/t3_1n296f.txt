I've heard of Random Acts of Pizza but never actually used it.  Right now it's getting into the later afternoon and I gotta say...I'm tired.  Payday is tomorrow and my stomach is hating the ramen I've been eating the last few days.

It would honestly make my entire day to have a filling, hot meal tonight.  I would love to pay it forward as soon as I have money in hand.  

Can anyone help me out?

EDIT:  Aw crud, I'm such a noob.  I left my location out of the title.  Sorry guys.  I'm in Bakersfield, California
