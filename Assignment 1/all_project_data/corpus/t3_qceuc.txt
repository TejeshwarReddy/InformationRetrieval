Don't get direct deposit from my job till past the delivery man's bedtime... just ate me a chicken pot pie and oatmeal because that's all I got left... very end of the month sure is fun, ain't it? I work my butt off and thus, come home and raid the hell out of my fridge... but at the end of this month I'm pretty much foodless till tomorrow. I would love me a pizza right now, so if you please, buy me a pizza, pepperoni will be fine, and I'll buy you two tomorrow when I actually have money. The only thing I love more than charity is rewarding charity. Thank you.
