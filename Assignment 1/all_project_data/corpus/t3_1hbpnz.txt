Hey, reddit! I just discovered this subreddit, and think it is amazing. 

I'm hanging out with friends from college that I don't see much and think this sub is amazing. I live near a dominos and a pizza hut, they're both relatively cheap. There's also a little Caesars which is very cheap I think like 5 dollars for a pizza. 

I wouldn't ask for a RAOP if we weren't all completely broke.  I have 40 dollars until 2 fridays from now, but a pizza for me and my friends would be amazing. Plus, an awesome story to share and might make my friends give reddit a shot! :) 


**If not, thanks for reading and have a great day fellow redditors! :)**

EDIT: Also, would definitely be willing to pay it forward once I find a second job :)
