Been following RAOP for a while for the d'aww of it and upvoting people who need it.

25 y/o here, I've always been independent so this is a little weird for me.  I was laid off from my job of 4 years 3 weeks ago.  After an intense job search, I was hired into an OK paying new job a week later(dancedancedance!) and everything is going fantastic there.  Their pay schedule is harsh (paid in arrears 1 week + 2 week delay = 3 weeks no pay) and I'm not due for a pay check until Friday.  My final paycheck  from my last job went into paying rent/keeping the power on/getting a bus pass etc etc. I'm the frugal type but even with my efficient spending, over the last few weeks I've dropped a lot of weight (down to 5'10" 125lbs). So just putting this out there since I'm darn hungry. Any kindness will be returned in the form of filling a request when I'm back up and running financially.  Vancouver, Washington is right next to Portland, Oregon. ... Northwest USA.

Thank you all for reading and for being there.  Happy Holidays to everyone!
