Hello /RAOP! I've been a Redditor for quite some time now, and have seen the amazing generosity that this forum can produce. (EDIT: This is not my main account. I can verify through PMs my other account.)

I've got two younger sisters, a mother going to school full time for her masters (almost there!), and a girlfriend. We all live under the same roof, and here lately, things have been a bit rough. We haven't been grocery shopping in about a month or so, and have no money do to so at the moment. We're holding out for our grants (we all go to school), but unfortunately those will not arrive for another couple of weeks. 

I beseech you RAOP, can you make our entire month? We would love to sit around the table and share a meal, it's been too long.

Thank you always for your generosity.

SIDENOTE - I can verify using the tool listed in the sidebar, as well as deliver pictures of our incredibly empty fridge/freezer and pantry.
