[On behalf of my girlfriend]
On the bus to the airport, for some reason my card (which has money on it) has been declined. 

I'm with my brother and he has no card or money. Haven't eaten anything at all today (had to leave for the airport very early).

When I get to Germany to (meeting my dad for the holidays), we're supposed to get the train to his house.. no money for that either lol, so basically today is probably going to suck. [UK]

(I'm writing on behalf of her as she is on the bus and has no internet and will have no internet in the airport if she has no money)
