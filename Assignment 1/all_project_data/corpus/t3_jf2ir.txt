Basically the title. I was in Baltimore looking at some potential apartments for my junior year in school. I think the pick-pocket got me while waiting in line at KFC because I didn't have it on me when I got up to the cashier to make the order :/ New card (and ID) is being sent but won't get here for a couple of days. I would really appreciate the help, you guys. 
Thanks in advance to anyone :)
