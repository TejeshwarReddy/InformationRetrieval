I have been away from my husband for what seems like years even though its been like 4 months. We live in different countries so getting all the paperwork in order had taken a toll on our wallets. Luckily my sister and grandmother let me move into their apartment that they just got here in Dallas, Texas. My sister was working in a emergency pet hospital that shut down two month ago. She's at a new job now, but for the last month we have been struggling with finances to keep all three of us a float and especially keeping our pets fed before us!
Us three would just be super grateful to have something besides dry pancakes this week, until the first of us sees a paycheck.
