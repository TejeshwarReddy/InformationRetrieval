Long story short, my friend put his dick in crazy and decided to drop me as a friend due to her jealousy of me (another female). I'm in between jobs, not starting my new one for a while. I would love to simultaneously comfort myself over the loss of a friend and celebrate my (eventual) new job with a good pizza, but I can't. Hugs for life if someone actually does this for me!
