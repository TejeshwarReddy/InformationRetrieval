Hi folks. Can't believe I'm actually asking here.

I was let go 3 weeks ago (southern California), and my old employer still hasn't given me my final check. I'm fighting, but as a person without credit cards I'm finding eating difficult. The wife and I are being as frugal as possible, but we have barely eaten since Friday.

I always made great money, but I was let go after sinking my entire savings into moving across the country for this new job.

I'm just begging for a meaty pizza mostly for my wife (/u/curiouslittlealice). She is anemic, so although supplements are helping she's still having a lot of trouble with a diet of rice and ramen.

Thanks everyone. I feel so horrible asking but I just don't have any money to get her anything more iron heavy right now.
