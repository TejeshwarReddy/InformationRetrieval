I have ramen, and a couple old soups. I'm not really in dire circumstances, just trying to get myself out of credit debt from years ago. (this was to take care of my late mother though). I also got hit with that magic "planets align to form one super big billing cycle with all my bills" time. I don't really expect any pizza, but if someone is rich and bored, i'm merely an outlet. My only offer to you is that i promise, on the soul of my dearest mother, to pay it forward in the coming weeks.
