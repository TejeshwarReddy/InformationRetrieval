Hey guys. So it's Friday night and I'm doing work/preparing for finals next week. It's a long night of work ahead of me...(weekend as well). I'm running low on funds (the heat bill this winter was been ridiculous) and a girl would love a nice old cheese pizza to feed me for the next day or so. There's a rumbly in my tumbly; it would make all this coding more bearable! 

Apparently the odds are slim but I would truly appreciate if someone would help me out. If not, peace, love...and enjoy your weekend!
