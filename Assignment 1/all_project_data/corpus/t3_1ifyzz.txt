Hey reddit,

My husband and I have been kicked off of food stamps for a few days because of paperwork not going through. We're getting that fixed, but money is super tight, and my parents showed up today to help finish the tiling in my grandma's bathroom. The house (especally upstairs) has little to no air condition, and it's really hot. I was hoping to offer a pizza for them for dinner when the work is done?

They really should get to eat, and we don't have the money, or food in the house, to feed them. So if anyone wants to buy us a pizza or 2 to share, that would be fantastic. 

If you want proof of my parent's work, I can provide that. 

Thanks in advance.

Edit: Ok, grandma messed up and mom and dad left. Hubby and I wouldn't mind a pizza if someone wants to give one though. Just thought it'd be fair to update.
