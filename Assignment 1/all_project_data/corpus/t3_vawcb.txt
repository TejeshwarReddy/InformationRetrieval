I am currently in the process of a move and have exhausted all of my funds in terms of truck, movers, etc.  I need my energy for tomorrow, and the rice I have isn't going to cut it (plus, my pots and pans are packed!).  I should be fine financially in a couple (2-3) weeks once my pay check kicks in, and I will pay it forward, as that's the right thing to do.  Can anyone PM me a gift card for $15-20?
