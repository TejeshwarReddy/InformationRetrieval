My husband and I each work 2 jobs so we do not have to live off of the state.  We have an infant (born April 21st) and we are happy parents, but money is tighter than ever. We haven't been able to afford to go on a "date" since before the baby was born.  Will someone help us have a nice date night in?
We are in the New London, CT area
