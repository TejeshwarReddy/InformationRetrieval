So, I deposited my paycheck after my bank's cutoff on Friday and my balance is negative until the check clears on Monday. If someone could shoot me a pizza, I would be happy to shoot a pizza back tomorrow. Consider it a pizza loan? Anyway, I haven't ate since Friday evening and I am absolutely starving.
