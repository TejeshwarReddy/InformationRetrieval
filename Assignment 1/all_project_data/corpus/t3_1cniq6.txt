Hello! As the title says, I'm just a college student, no sob story unless you count being perpetually broke. I had an evening class tonight that doesn't let out until after all the dining halls close, so I'm not starving, just craving some cheesy goodness. 

I've never requested pizza before so I feel a little weird about it, but I thought it couldn't hurt. Eventually I'd like to be on the other side of things giving the pizza, maybe during the summer when I tend to have a little more available funds. 

I also feel weird about being such an anonymous face behind a computer screen so here are a few facts about me! 

* I'm studying criminal justice and psychology and hoping to go to law school if I ever get out of undergrad.

* I really like Doctor Who, Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, etc. (you know, all the good shows :] )

* I love to read. My current book is Stephen King's Night Shift.

* I'm absolutely terrible at talking about myself so the facts end here.

If anyone is gracious enough to grant me a pizza, they have my sincere thanks in advance. Maybe I could doodle you a pokemon or something.
