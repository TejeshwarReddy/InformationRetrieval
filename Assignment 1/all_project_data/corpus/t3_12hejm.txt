After being unemployed since June, I finally started a new job three weeks ago. The job is great except for they didn't key in my time worked my first week. So I won't be paid for another two weeks. During my time of unemployment I began taking care of two of my siblings, which caused me to go through my savings faster than I would have. Now I'm at the end of the road and really have to make eveything last these next two weeks. 

I would really appreciate a pizza to help us a long and would be a nice surprise for them. I will definitely pay it back/foward as soon as I can. Thanks!
