College student, Just had out-patient surgery for moles that are being tested for carcinoma/melanoma. The Copay was more than I anticipated and have $16 in the bank left over (I can send verification of this, if requested). A Pizza would be great to help beat the pain that's starting to set in. 

PapaJohns is my go to pizza place

Here I am all bandaged up!
