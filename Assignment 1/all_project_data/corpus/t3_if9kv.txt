I'm new here so please have patience while I figure this out. I'm having a pregnancy craving for pizza but flat broke till payday. (Can show pics of the cobwebs in my wallet) I'm really cheap! Dominoes only costs me like $15ish to deliver and I have $5.97 in the bank so all I need is $10 in a dominos ecard or something! Would gladly love to repay the favor on payday! I think this is a great idea! Also I'm in the southern California area.
