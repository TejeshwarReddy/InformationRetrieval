Summer break has not been good to me this year. The jobs I've been hoping to recieve have slipped through my fingers and the few jobs I have been able to get have been low pay and barely covering the bills. I finally got a new job where I was making a little bit of extra money and decided to treat myself nice for the first time in months and buy a few cool things on Amazon, right after that my car breaks down. Im living on oatmeal, rice and ramen... I really think a nice pizza would warm my spirits. If anyone could help out, i'd really appreciate it!
