Hey RAOP, we all know how tough of an economy it is. I didn't expect to have to ask strangers for assistance, but even my mother had fallen in hard times. I recently obligated my contract with Army and am having a hard time reintegration. I haven't had a lot of luck and a pizza would really help. I need a haircut too, but I think that might be a different subreddit. I hope to be able to do the same for someone else in the future. 

Eternally thankful, .39Â¢.
