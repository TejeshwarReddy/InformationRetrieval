Hey - The title says it all. After a week of exams, I'm letting myself spend the weekend playing Oblivion, since Skyrim is soon to come out, and I have yet to play Oblivion for myself.

I'm waiting for a client (freelance webdesign is my job) to pay me Sunday, so until then, I really have no food other than chili I made 5 days ago, and has been my only meals every day since.

I'll even do any crazy thing you tell me to do in game, if you're familiar with Oblivion, and consider it done (for better or for worst). I'll murder towns in the name of pizza!

It'd really help - thanks!
