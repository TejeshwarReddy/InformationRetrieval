Hey reddit,

I'm; not gonna bore everyone with my sob story, but it's been a long hard road to find and get a job in this economy, and I couldn't be happier,

Sadly, my food supplies have run out for the rest of the week, and wondered if someone had it in their soul to help a guy about to turn his life around.

I'll be back on here ASAP to pay it forward when I can.
