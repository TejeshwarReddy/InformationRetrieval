I would be grateful times infinity for the generosity! ;)
I am 25 and back with my parents after a year on campus (off-campus apartment) at KSU (kent state university) in Ohio. I moved home June 1, tapped out financially, lost my apartment. While living in Kent, OH I experienced a break-up of epic proportion... my partner moved out mid-way through the Spring semester and I have not been the same ever since. To be completely honest I have no idea what direction I am headed next as far as continuing my education, making a career choice, and by some miracle digging my way out of this financial grave I have dug myself into. (car is up for repo, cell phone is shut off)... yes, it's that bad. Now i'm here, back at home, not a clue what my future will hold as of right now. (I thought my 20's were supposed to be the 'best' years... lol) They were good, however, up until the point I lost my way. To make matters worse... my parents are struggling to make ends meet. My younger brother also lives here (23) and corrals shopping carts at the local Wal-Mart part-time with an associates degree in IT. My mother is laid off from the Heinz manufacturing facility she works at for the next 2 weeks so money is even tighter. It would be nice to suddenly have pizza and surprise everyone here ;)... where it is ordered from doesn't bother me, I have never been picky. 

Thought I would try this out and ask. It would sure brighten my day and the other 3 members of the household as well. 
(Can send photos on receipt! :D and of course a [Thanks] post).
