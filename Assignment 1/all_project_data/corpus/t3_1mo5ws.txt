We were leaving from his high school today (I do a bridge program so I go to my tech college and get back to my base school before it gets out), and as he was driving (north) down the road to leave the school, this guy barrels through the parking lot (going west) and we hit him. He has a volvo, so the external damage was minimal for a car crash, but the interior damage was bad. The windshield was cracked, a bunch of the paneling was destroyed, one of the front headlights was cracked and the airbags messed a bunch of things up. I think it's what messed up the front windshield. I hit my head and he got cuts and burns from the airbags and probably lost his car (nicknamed victor). 
The other driver was honest about it, but the officer said that since it was on school ground (technically private property for some reason) he could not claim fault. So now my friend is going to have to battle with insurance on just getting his car fixed and the money for that. I'm going to try and drive him around whenever I have enough gas to go anywhere. Any help is appreciated and he was planning on getting some pizza today, but he said "I just want to relax for now." Everyone decided to call off the little social gathering we had, but it would be sweet if he could still get a pizza. Thanks guys and sorry this was so long.

TL;DR: Friend gets hit by another student driver on his birthday. His car is wrecked, may not get insurance money, and birthday is ruined. Thanks!
