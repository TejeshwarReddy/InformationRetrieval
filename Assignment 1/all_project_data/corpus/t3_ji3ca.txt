I'm a stay at home mom with my 2 year old son. I have a boyfriend that works 12 hours a week for basically nothing half the time. He's having a hard time keeping food on the table. I wouldn't ask if I really didn't need it. But I have warn the supply I had in my cabinets down to nothing. I just need a little help please. I will give you any proof you need. I will even pay it forward some how when I can. Thank you for reading.

[EDIT] My boyfriend made enough money last night to buy us some groceries for a few days. So as much as I appreciate you guys offering I no longer need it. I couldn't in good conscious take a pizza I dont really need. Specially since there are so many people on here that need food. Thank you so much for offering, it really makes me smile that their are some awesome people out there willing to help a stranger. I hope that if I ever need help again that I will be as lucky to find people with hearts like yours! &lt;3
