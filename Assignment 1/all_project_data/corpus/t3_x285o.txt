Three years ago today i tried a meatlovers pizza, this may come across as weird but seeing as how i am a jew it makes sense, and the joy it brought to me was incredible. So incredible that i in fact that being a 19yr old jew saw no reason to continue in that religion bc i was held back from pizza that long and for what reason?? cause the greatest food on earth, BACON, was considered "unclean"??? Negative ghostrider the pattern is fulll. i need another pizza, soon or else bad things will happen to my friends. their life is in ur hands. Help a little old jewish guy and his broke friends out...get a NIGGA his pizza.
