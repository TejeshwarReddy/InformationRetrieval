My friend Brittany could REALLY use some cheering up.  She's down at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, FL for the week because the hospitals and doctors here in Alabama have not been able to give her a clear diagnosis or course of treatment for what we can really only identify as a degenerative brain condition.  She's down there without her husband or any of her close friends right now, because none of us could afford to take time off work to be there with her - we pretty much all used up what vacation time we had on her last visit last month.

Understandably, she's very freaked out and upset at being down there by herself and having to face the possibility of neurosurgery this week alone.  I'd like to try and cheer her up, but we spent all my "able to spend this" money just to help GET her down there ($500 just from me, and more from her husband and my girlfriend to cover it all).  Given that stress doesn't help her condition, it bothers me that she's under such pressure alone and I can't help any more than this.

That's why I'm asking you guys.  Can we get her a pizza from a stranger to help restore some of her feeling that things will be okay?
