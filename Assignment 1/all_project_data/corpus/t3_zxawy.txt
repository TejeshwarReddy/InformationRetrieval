I think its gotten to the point where the lack of food is keeping me from sleeping soundly at night. I can't think of any other reason why I only slept 3 hours last night.

I get off work today probably around 3pm but the money just covers rent and gas and I have to drive an hour home. My alma mater is playing football at 7pm tonight and I'd just really enjoy a pizza and some breadsticks or soda from Dominos or something for dinner for once.

I actually feel terrible asking for a meal... I should have just foregone this...
