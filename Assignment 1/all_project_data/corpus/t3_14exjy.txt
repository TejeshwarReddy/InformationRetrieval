Tomorrow is my first final of finals weeks and I'm already feeling more stressed than anyone should be. These are my last finals ever and I want to finish college on a good note. This semester has given me nothing but a headache. Anyone want to help out a stressed student? I'd be eternally grateful and forever in your debt.
