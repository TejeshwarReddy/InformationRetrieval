I've been trying to figure out how to send fellow canadian AridDecay a pizza or two - he posted in r/Assistance looking for help and I wanted to send him a warm treat for halloween.

Unfortunately it seems my plans have fallen through - no one will let me pay with CC online, has to be in person.

If anyone could help him out that'd be super cool. I feel mega-bad at failing. =(
