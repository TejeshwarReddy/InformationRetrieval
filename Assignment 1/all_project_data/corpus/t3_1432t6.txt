I think, finally, my roommate and I have hit rock bottom right before things start to look up, which always seems to be how it goes, doesn't it?

We have less than five dollars in the house, I maxed my credit card ages ago, and I won't be getting paid until next friday and god knows when he will as he hasn't even started his new job yet. 

I'm so proud of how far we've come, starting the year more or less homeless to being able to afford a house and a dog until he lost his job. We managed to scrape together rent for this month, but I'd really rather not eat rice for the next seven days as that is literally all we have left in our cupboard aside from some baking essentials. Rice, waffles, and cake, diet of champions...

I would offer something in exchange but anything I can make costs more to ship than I will have for ages. If you want I can draw you something, I guess? Any help would be beyond appreciated and once he starts his job in a couple weeks, I will be sure to pay it forward!
