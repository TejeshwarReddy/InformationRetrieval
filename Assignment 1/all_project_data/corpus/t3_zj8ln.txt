I left my house at 7:00 and I'm just getting home now, 9:00pm. The crazy long commute is a regular thing for me. It a pain in the ass. Oh, and my SO is gone for the weekend, no close friends are around and I have nothing else to do on this Friday night other than reddit and watching tv shows online.
