Just looking for something to help out the parents, everyone's been stressed and there's not much money to go around for food at the moment. I will be able to pay it back in full on Tuesday with a little extra if needed/wanted.

EDIT: If anything does come through before these places close I'd be using http://www.just-eat.co.uk/ if it's of any relevance. 

EDIT 2: Thanks for the upvotes guys but unfortunately it's time for me to sleep soon and it's getting closer to closing hours for places near me. Thanks and maybe I'll have better luck in another time of pizza need. :)
