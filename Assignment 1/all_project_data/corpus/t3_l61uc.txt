This is a throwaway, I'm not ready for my friends who know me on reddit to know what happened. If someone wants to know my real username before buying, I'd gladly tell them. 

So I'm honestly just having an incredibly shitty day, and a kind gesture from a stranger would really help me feel better. I'd really appreciate it.

Thank you!
