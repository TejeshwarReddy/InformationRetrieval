I'm at home, in between work earlier and work later, drinking some beer, and have no pizza to go with it. I am very sad. I read the sidebar, too, but I don't know if I am doing the steps right because there are a lot of words over there. 

When I get home from work later, I'll probably buy a pizza for a nice hungry person though. Pizza for me now, pizza for you later.

Here is me with my beer:
