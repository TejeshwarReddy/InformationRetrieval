Just tried the 50% off any handmade pan pizza one while making an online order and it says it's not valid here. Was really hoping to get a cheap pizza cause even though we can't really afford it at half price, I could swing it. We *definitely* can't afford it at full price though.

Edit: Clarified wording.
