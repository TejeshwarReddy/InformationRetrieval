Isla Vista, CA. Down to my last few dollars on my last week of school, with nothing but Top Ramen left. I almost think all the sodium is starting to make me tweak. Or maybe it's just all the instant coffee.

EDIT: EvilCactus sent me a gift card early this morning. Thank you to all who offered to help! Reddit's kindness never ceases to amaze me.
