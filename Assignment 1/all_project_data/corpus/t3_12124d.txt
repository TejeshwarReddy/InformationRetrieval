Hey RAoP, I made a new account as to not alert my redditing (now ex) girlfriend.. I have had just about the shittiest couple weeks and it all started with my beautiful girlfriend of almost three years leaving me and now I don't have anymore money for food until Monday.  I would love it if someone would help a guy who is down on his luck but not going to give up.  She has dreams and aspirations that she didn't think could be fulfilled by being with me so I will now assume the role of the best friend I can be and support/always cheer her on and I hope she does incredible things in this world.  As for me, it's time to re-assess.  Cheers, RAoP
