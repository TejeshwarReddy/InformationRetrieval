Normally we go out to eat but with my schooling taking up all my time/money and my fiance having recently lost his job, that's just not an option this year.  We have been struggling for a while now - you pretty much have to know someone to get a job in this tiny town (middle of nowhere Missouri).  We are living with my fiance's mom, stepdad, grandma, and sister and funds are always very limited; pizza is a huge commodity. 














If someone could please help brighten up our anniversary we would be so incredibly thankful and promise to pay it forward when we're back on our feet.  I would keep it a secret from my fiance until it's ready, try to make it as fun as possible, ya know?  : )
