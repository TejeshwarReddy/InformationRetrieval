We are located in Pensacola, FL. Paid off a lot of bills, debt with the last pay check and also didn't want to have to move a bunch of food with us. We underestimated how long our food would last. We have some noodles and jello and non-perishables left but we'd love some pizza! 

We'll try to pay it forward once we get settled in our new home. Thanks!
