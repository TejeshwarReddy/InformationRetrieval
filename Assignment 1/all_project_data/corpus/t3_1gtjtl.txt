I was laid off in January and have been receiving unemployment since then while trying to find more work, but existing bills wipe out pretty much all of my funds every month aside from basic foodstuffs. My fiancee recently started a plush toy business but it is building slowly and doesn't bring in very much money for us yet. We've been eating variations on beans and rice, potatoes, and stir fry for the last several weeks and frankly we're both really tired of it.

We both tried donating plasma today (there is a company near our house that pays $20 for a first donation), but she's on lithium so couldn't do so and the phlebotomist informed me that I couldn't give because my veins were too narrow. For the first time in months things are looking up--I have three or four good job leads that could be coming to fruition in the next couple of weeks--and we really were hoping to get some pizza as a change of pace.

My fiancee even says she'd be happy to send a plushy as thanks once we've got the money to ship something out--I'd be happy to provide examples of her work via PM if you're interested.

Thanks for looking!

* edit: Should probably add that, while we live in Dallas proper, we live in a very rural part of Dallas and the only major chains nearby that deliver to our area are Pizza Hut and Papa Johns (yes, I know reddit hates Papa Johns).

* edit2: been pizza'd thanks to pineapple_wolf! Woo!
