Hey guys, hoping that someone can help me out. I just got my last check of the summer and every dime of it just went to my first month's rent, leaving me with no money and nothing but ramen until I move in next week. Frankly, I don't want ramen anymore, so I'm asking you guys if I could get some help to start my last full weekend of the summer before school starts. I will **definitely** return the favor once I move in and find a job. You can hold me to it!
Oh, I live about 30 mins outside of Charlotte, NC.
