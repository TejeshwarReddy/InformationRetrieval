Hey, I live in Bremerton, Washington and currently I'm babysitting my cousins for about a week while my aunt goes on vacation with her husband, My grandpa currently has the money and he only spends the money on beer and cigerattes and we're almost out completely. I was hoping that someone would be kind enough to buy a pizza for us, as we're knd of sick of cereal. ;-;
