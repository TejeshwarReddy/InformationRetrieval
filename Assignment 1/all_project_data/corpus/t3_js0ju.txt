I am 21 years old and a few months ago my boss unexpectedly cut my hours from 30 hours per week to 5 hours per week. I have been working 1 day per week for the past two months. That's about $200 per month, obviously this has been rough. During my job hunt, I swallowed my pride and got food stamps. This month I have somehow ran out early, and I pretty much only have condiments and cans of beans. I had a very promising job interview yesterday after submitting tons of applications and countless phone calls! I mean, it's retail.. but I am just excited to get myself on a path back to better things. I wanted to celebrate with myself and fill my tummy to prepare for more hunting (job hunting is tiring without a car) and what better to do that with but pizza! :)

I will provide any proof needed. I will also take a photo of the pizza if received. 

you would seriously be making my day (actually, a pizza could feed me for a few days)! And hopefully I got this job so I can offer pizza in the future!
