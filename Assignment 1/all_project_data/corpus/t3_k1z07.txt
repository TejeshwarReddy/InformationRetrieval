Hey RAoP, I had court today.  I got my second minor about a week ago and I feel like shit.  I had court, and the judge ordered me 500 dollars in fines and 40 hours community service.  I'm a pretty good kid, but I like to party and drink, and I got pulled over biking home from a party.  I'm living in a house, I'm a sophomore @ NDSU. I don't feel like cooking anything.  Been cruising Reddit for about 5 hours now.  Oh yeah, missed a calc quiz and my TA won't let me reschedule, she said that court wasn't an acceptable excuse. So I'm starting Calc 1 with a zero.  Thanks guys.
