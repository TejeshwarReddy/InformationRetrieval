We're not yet at the point where we need an emergency pizza, but given the expenses coming up this September (mainly uni fees, rent and rail/m√©tro transport cards), it might be useful to see if anyone could help us out a couple of weeks or so from now. Anybody out there willing to help out a nearly broke Redditor in France?
