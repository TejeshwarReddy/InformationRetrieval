Hi! My parents are out of town and I'm flat broke in real life money BUT I have some money in a paypal account. Would anyone be willing to order me a pizza and then accept a paypal reimbursement + a 5 dollar tip?

A magnificent redditor by the name of mmmcandy has helped me out. He is one bad ass mother fucker... who likes candy. Thank you!
