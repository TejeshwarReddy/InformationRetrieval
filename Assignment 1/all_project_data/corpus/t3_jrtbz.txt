I work at an electronics store over here and I need something for lunch today and tomorrow. I have some change but I really don't feel like just eating cheez-its today haha. I plan on taking my lunch break at around 4 or 5pm. Then I would save the rest from today for lunch tomorrow and maybe Thursday. I promise to return the favor when I get paid this weekend to you or anyone else on here that needs some pizza in their lives :)
