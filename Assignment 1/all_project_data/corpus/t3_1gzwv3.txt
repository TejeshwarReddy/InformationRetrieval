It's my niece's birthday and she is turning 8. Normally my folks (her grandparents) would get some dinner and a cake, but they're both out of town so it's just me, her mother and her. Her mom hasn't gotten a paycheck yet and my bank account is currently low as well... I thought about making some cupcakes instead as a substitute b-day cake. But my niece would really like some pizza for dinner, it's her fav. :)

I'll pass it forward as soon as I'm able to, so any takers?
