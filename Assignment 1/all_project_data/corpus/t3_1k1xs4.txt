My mother is a nurse, and has been working the night shift at work for the past few days, and hasn't gotten paid yet. Child support hasn't come in either. All us kids have been eating the past couple of days are crackers and dry cereal, and lightly with them. Not trying to sound like a sob story, but some pizza would really lighten our spirits. Thanks!
Edit: Already getting helped out, thanks PhysicsGirl!
