Hey, I haven't had a real meal in a week. I was unjustly fired from my job and am awaiting an appeal over unemployment. Meanwhile, I'm looking for work and school just restarted. Finding work around my classes hasn't been easy. Most are waiter jobs and all want to speak with my previous employer. Its a rainy Sunday here in the DC area and a good meal would do a lot for raising my spirits. Thanks.
