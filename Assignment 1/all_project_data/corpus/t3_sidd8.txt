Hi all.  

LOL....I've been staring at this page for quite a while trying to get up the nerve to ask for a pizza.  I wrote it once, went to get the verification code as it stated I should and came back to find I have to start from scratch!

Yes, newcomer, stands out bright and clear, I'm sure, lol.

O.K.  

I had only recently been back to work.  Hours and paychecks have been small but workable.  However, I have had to say "no" so many times to family that I would like to offer a "yes" for a change.

If anyone can help, I would be able to pay it forward in a week, or repay giver.  Whichever works here.

Thank you.  :)
