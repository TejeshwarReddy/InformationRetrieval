Just moved to my first house and while I'm far from poor, the first swarm of deposits/bills has wiped me out and today is my first day off in two weeks since starting my job.  (X-ray Technologist at a 450+  bed Acute Care/Trauma hospital)  

We are tired of soup and my roommate's stomach is quite a bit louder than my own.
