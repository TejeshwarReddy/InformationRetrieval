I live in a small house with my Grandma and my Boyfriend, He is visiting from Ireland and he is leaving in 5 days.
My gramma has been low on work, and shes 58 and I haven't found a job yet. Finally being of age to get a job i figured it would be easy but in this economy its not. 
I'm NOT starving, but I am hungry for that warm cheesy pepperoni taste of pizza straight from the oven. I've Mowed lawns around my neighborhood to put food in my house and i'm running low on cash. Food is scarce and i have to wait till my grandmas next pay day for gas. Please help me and my boyfriend and grandma have a delicious dinner tonight. It would be much appreciated. 

Even if i and my family don't get one, when i get a job i will be sure to help others here.
