So I'm a 19 year old guy who had colon surgery the other day. I've been stuck at home for a while and have depleted all of the microwavable food I've had. I must have eaten 10 packs of ramen over the past few days and a pizza would be great. If anyone is offering, it'd be greatly appreciated. 

EDIT: Just found out Domino's doesn't deliver to my house (I live too out of the way, I guess) and I can't leave because of the pain killers I'm on. Only place that delivers is Papa Ginos. Sorry for the inconvenience everyone. =/
