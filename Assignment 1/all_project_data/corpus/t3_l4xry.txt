So I got laid off from my job 2 weeks ago and thought I would find something by now. I've had some interviews, but still waiting to hear from some places i've had very good interviews with. I'm totally broke. I think I might just have exactly $15 in my bank account. I'm hungry and ramen is killing me now. What money I had went to my cat's fancy food (One has a urinary problem thus both have to eat the same food because the one is a food lurker)  If anyone could help supply me with a couple days worth of any awesome pizza, me love you long time
