I'm feeling pretty melancholy. Will be driving 40 minutes on the last gasoline that I have to the RMV to get a new driver's license tomorrow. Luckily, my brother lives nearby, so he's going to lend me the money I need to get a new license. Any size pizza of any type from any nearby place would go a very long way for me (tomorrow would be fantastic, but so would any time this week!) I haven't been able to go food shopping yet this week as I don't get paid until Friday so I have almost nothing to eat here.

Much love guys and thank you for reading.
