Sup RAOPists, 

So I'm in Bellingham hanging out with MY GIRLFRIEND and was curious if this RAOP thing worked. We just finished a 6 mile hike and don't have much money to spare. We decided if we could convince any kind soul to donate a pizza to us, that would be flippin sweet, and we'll pay it forward later in the future when we have more $$$. Anyone?

EDIT: pizza order has been placed by a person who prefers to remain anonymous. Thank you muchlies, good sir or madam!

EDIT 2: And now with a picture! http://i.imgur.com/G9Rog.jpg We got a large pizza with half Hawaiian and half cheese, cuz Heather is a lame vegetarian who also dislikes pineapple.

Peace love and hugs,
-Scott and Heather
