Hello,

I don't have much to offer in exchange besides possibly creating a Sim for any Sims 3 players, but I'm stuck inside the apartment with a bad knee for the fireworks/festivities tonight and was wondering if someone might be out here who was looking to spread some cheer for the next year.

Thanks, and I hope your night is warm and in the presence of good company.

edit** In case you're wondering about the Sims 3, I submitted an album to /r/thesims a bit ago with some celebrity sims that I made:
