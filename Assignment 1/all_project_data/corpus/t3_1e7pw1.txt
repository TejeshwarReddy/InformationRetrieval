I've known about this subreddit for about a week, but I've been kind of reluctant to request because I see people who have either had really good or really bad things happen to them, and I would feel bad if I got a pizza they didn't. I still don't have anything really good or really bad happening to me, I'd just like a pizza and can't afford one, as well as I've got a lot of school work to do this evening. I worked through lunch (I just forgot) and for dinner they only had chicken (I worked at a chicken factory, so it's kind of difficult for me to eat chicken and not feel at least a little queasy), I ate a couple bowls of cereal but I think I'm going to be up pretty late as I'm also studying for a polisci exam on Tuesday, and I am already getting the rumbles, if someone could help me out this evening, I would truly appreciate it and be more than willing to pay it forward.

Edit: The only place that delivers here (there is one other, but the owner verbally abused a good friend of mine while she was at work for not handing out flyers the day after he dropped them off at the office) actually closes at 11, but thank you for taking the time to read it, have a good day and  if you're looking for a sign to buy someone a pizza or you're just too embarrassed to request one, go for it, take part in this community!
