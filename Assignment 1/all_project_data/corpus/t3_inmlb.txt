Hey I posted in another post but haven't heard anything, so here it goes.  Here's my story; I am a 21 year old starving college student who currently doesn't have enough money to eat.  I had to pay double rent this month as well as the next and to top it all off, got a urinating in public ticket on my 21 run! FML to the fullest.

I'm a new user because I was just introduced to this community this week. My friend then helped me set up an account when she heard I haven't eaten anything but hot pockets this past 2 weeks.

Would really appreciate a pizza for a change. Thanks for reading!
