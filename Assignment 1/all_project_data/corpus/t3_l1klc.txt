Like the title says I'm in a tight spot and could really use a warm pizza to lift my spirits and give me a break from KD. As it stands I won't be able to both pay bills and afford groceries when I get paid so this would be a huge boost. I'm a long time redditor and am happy to PM you from my main account to verify this as well as provide any other info you would like.   
EDIT: Thanks to the wonderful DEStudent I will be having pizza for supper! Thank you so much!
