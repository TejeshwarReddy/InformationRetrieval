I've been eating nothing but ramen and *extremely* cheap frozen dinners for the past three weeks (jobless, looking.) and it'd just be nice to eat something that rises above the blandness of my current diet. I'm in Tucson, AZ and there's both a dominos and a pizza hut by my house.

EDIT: Pastafarian sent me a generous dominoes gift card (I'll be sure to get pizza with my youngest brother (he's in summer school and his hours at work have been cut) all this week :) ) and Bluehairedfreak ordered a delivery before he/she got my message regarding pastafarian so I got pizza for tonight as well. Thank you so much to both of you; you're great people.
