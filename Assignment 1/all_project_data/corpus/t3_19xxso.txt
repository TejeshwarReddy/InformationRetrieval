 Moved to New York recently and the city really is as expensive as everyone says it is. I ran out of cash till Friday and kind of hungry. Just found out about this subreddit and I'd be eternally grateful for anything someone can throw my way. I promise to pay it forward when my payday comes along.
 Thank you
