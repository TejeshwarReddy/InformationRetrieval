My husband was recently reassigned to a new unit (he's a soldier) and he wasn't sure if he was going to be able to take time off for our already booked trip to Vegas. We just celebrated our 9yr. anniversary last week, and this was going to be our first vacation together. I know it's frivolous, but he just got word that his leave was approved and I was hoping to celebrate with some sort of dinner out. Our problem is that payday isn't until the first so we're broke. I know that's a really long story for a simple question, but there it is. 

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this :)
