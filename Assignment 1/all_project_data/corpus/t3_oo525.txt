**EDIT! The wonderful Hrnmyd has provided me with the pizza I asked for! THANK YOU SO MUCH!**

I just started college in Virginia and there was a mix-up at the unemployment office, so I have no money for books, bills, rent or food. My girlfriend and I are currently living on ramen noodles. It's been two weeks now and the Unemployment Office still hasn't set things right.

Come February, my GI Bill money should start rolling in and I'll be able to pay for rent, food, books and everything, no problem.
Once the money comes in, I promise to pay it forward TWICE.

If anyone is willing to help us get over this hump, I would greatly appreciate it. And like I said, the favor will be repaid twice.
Thank you.
