This is my first RAoP post, so I don't really know what else to say...Guess I'll start here: I moved to Philadelphia in August and got a job at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, but I got laid off right before Thanksgiving because of over-hiring. I've yet to get any good reception from the places I've applied at, its at the point where all I have to eat right now is ramen and stale Tostitos. I tried filing for unemployment but since I'm not yet a PA resident (originally from South Jersey) I'm ineligible. 

My roommates have been giving me food but I feel bad mooching off of them for so long, and I'd like to be able to give them some food for a change. That's where you guys come in. 

Well, that's about it. Thanks for reading.
