Hey guys,

I work part time, go to school, and I support my disabled mom who would be homeless otherwise. I'm dead broke ($0.64 in my bank account, I think) till I get paid on tuesday and there is no food in my fridge/pantry (I bought mom a few days worth of groceries yesterday).

I'd love to have a pizza or two to get me through till tuesday when I get paid. I'll pay it forward in january when things should be looking up for both myself and my mom.

Edit: I didn't post on my regular reddit name because I didn't want it out there on that name I'm having issues. If you want, though, I'll give you that name and send you a PM from it.

Edit: **THANK YOU!!!**  I got a pizza gift card, and that person wishes to remain anonymous.
