we are all studying aboard and like everyone else here we are having financial issues but nothing that serious. If you are feeling a bit generous today, go ahead and make our day :)

Info: 5 students, 3 Spanish, 1 Canadian and one arabic.
Also you can always order stuff online if you dont feel like calling, 

Thanks. ^_^
