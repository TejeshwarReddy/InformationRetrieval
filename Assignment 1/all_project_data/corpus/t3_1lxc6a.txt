Girlfriend and her work buddies are pre-drinking at mine, I cant afford to go out, or buy pizza. But being surrounded by this bitchy, whingy and no doubt at some point tearful selection of "Ladies" ( this term is more loose than many of them ). They have invited me to join them out but tbh Socialising with them makes me fear for my IQ. 

I get paid on 20th so pizza me today and I pizza you / pay back then ? more of a random loan of pizza !
