I just finished my last day as an intern! I spent 3 months as a glorified slave with no income, and have been rewarded with a job offer at the company (part-time, but at least it's relevant to my degree). New job starts Monday but for now I'm still far beyond broke. I'd love to blow off some steam and celebrate the end of this hellish experience. Anybody who would help me out would instantly reach hero status in my mind.
