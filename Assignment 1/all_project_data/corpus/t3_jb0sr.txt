Long story short, somehow paypal repeated the same transactions until all my money in both my checking and savings accounts were gone. Got a call at work from my bank saying that i had no money and i need to pay for the overdraft charges. Taking 4 hours of paper work, they told me that it will take 3 - 4 weeks to get my money back, if I get it back. My paycheck went directly to my bank account which was taken. I have 4 dollars cash to last me 3 -4 weeks...
