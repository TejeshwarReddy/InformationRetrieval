Hi everyone,

I've been scrounging around for money for awhile now that I'm taking an extra summer course load (something that will ultimately save me money in the long run). My friend, a fellow redditor, suggested that if I was ever hungry and needed help, there were people in a magic place that would get you a pizza. Well, I'm finishing up with a really long week of backstage work and if I could have a pizza when I got home later tonight, it would make me such a happy boy.

I didn't believe it, but here I am. I'm an avid fan of Star Trek, Archer, and theater to give you a little info about myself. 

Anyone willing to help will receive a long distance air-five and lots of appreciation from my empty belly. :D
