I wanted to say I'm absolutely heart broken, but didn't want to give the wrong impression.  I don't know why, buy my best friend that I've spent all of the last year spending every free second with, suddenly wants very little to do with me and is causing me to feel extremely left out with all of our mutual friends.  Plus, I've honestly never loved someone more than her, so I don't know if I've ever hurt this much before.  It's terrible and confusing.

On top of that, a couple friends suddenly suffering from massive depression, drug use, and self harm, trying desperately to take care of them and am just so so drained and lonely because of everything.

Just trying to get past these next two weeks with tons of school work and exams, so hoping for some pizza or just some Reddit love and motivation would help with the loneliness and anxiety.
