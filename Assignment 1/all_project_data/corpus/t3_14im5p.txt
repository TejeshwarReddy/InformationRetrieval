My mother just found out that because of my minimum wage job that I work on the weekends we will no longer be receiving food stamps. Although they gave us $300 a month for food I am only making a little over $100 for my own personal teenage expenses. (Clothes, school things, going out, savings, etc.) We are all really craving some Dominoes and it'd be awesome if someone wanted to help out! (:
