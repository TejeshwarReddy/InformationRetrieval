I just got home.  Checked my mail.  One lone piece in the box.  A very recognizable SASE.  In it, nicely folded in thirds, was my divorce decree.  Nothing else, just a little certificate.  I know what it is, but I read it over anyway, cause hey, it hurts more if you let the words fully sink in.  

Yesterday was my birthday.  One day you're 36, the next day you're divorced.

Not that I had many choices, but I was going to cook dinner tonight.  Now I don't want to do anything.  

I had to borrow $100 today to cover all the checks I mailed out on the first including rent.  I don't get paid until next week.  The divorce wasn't cheap, and now I get to officially make her payments every month.  The fun never ends.

I thought hey, I'll just get a pizza.  Oh wait no, my life is a mess and I have no money.

If anyone can help me out, I'll be sure to do the same for someone next week.

If not, just tell me it's going to get better.
