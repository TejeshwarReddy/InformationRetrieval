I am a single mother of a wonderful 9 year old boy. For the past 4 years I worked in group homes assisting individuals with developmental disabilities. I was unfairly terminated from my job and recently had to move in with someone because I couldnt make the rent. I would love to be able to sit down with my son and serve him Pizza for dinner it would be a nice change of pace from the usual mix of ramen noodles and staples that we get with govt. assistance. I will be "Offering" as soon as I get back on my feet..........
