Instead of eating food I've been playing Borderlands on OnLive most of the day for the past 2 days. I'm completely out of food, I got a cup of flour but that isn't even enough to bother with. I've been unemployed since March, turned down for every kind of assistance I applied for, and a few weeks back they closed the one food pantry nearby I was getting what little I could from. 

Somebody I grouped with earlier killing told me to look this place up, see if I'm lucky enough to score some eats. I've been cutting lawns, doing the flea market thing, but I am tapped and have no idea when I'm gonna get anything else in. People ain't buying like they used to so even Craigslist and Ebay failed me.

Please, I need something to eat. I'm on my second play through for this character I started yesterday and I can't keep ignoring the stomach for long. Orange drops or not, Borderlands is not a substitute for edibles.
