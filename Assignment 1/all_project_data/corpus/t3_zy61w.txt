My girlfriend and I are  broke, waiting on the GI Bill to get around to paying me this month, and have only PB&amp;amp;J to eat until the money arrives. (We're running out of bread.)

So here's my proposition:

If you will buy us a pizza, I will write you a poem, and not just some crappy haiku. My girlfriend will draw a picture to go with the poem. And once the money comes in, we will pay it forward by purchasing a pizza for someone else!

So, any takers?
