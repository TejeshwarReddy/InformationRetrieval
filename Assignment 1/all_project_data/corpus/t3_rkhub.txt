Howdy all, long time pizza provider here. Some folks at [/r/starcraft](/r/starcraft) put together a king of the hill tournament and stream it every night in different player skill levels.

It gives newer and experienced players a place to have fun and their own 15 minutes of fame. They don't give out prizes really, but winners get a reddit icon. Some users send a T-shirt to people who win more than X games in a row.

Would RAOP be interested in providing a pizza to the winner of a raffle? I want to give everyone who watches and plays a ticket into the raffle and pick a winner for ROAP to offer pizza.

Viewers who tweet @Something will be given one entry. Players who lose are given 2 entries, and winners would be given 3 entries per win.

I'm sorry if I violated any rules of this subreddit. I'm not trying to create some scam, and I don't run the event - it's organically composed - but this is technically still a (statistically) random act of pizza.

**EDIT** DERP they have a  website too http://rcraftgaming.com
