Me and my girlfriend and her little nieces just got back from walking to jack in a box hoping to get 2 orders of tacos for the 3 bucks in pennies and nickels we had, but there was a problem, the cashier was a total jerk and did not want to take our change because she didn't want to count the bit we had there. So now i feel bad for her ( and my future) nieces ;) and we are on the hunt for random pizza !
