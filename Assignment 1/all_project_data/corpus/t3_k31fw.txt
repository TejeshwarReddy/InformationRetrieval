I am a single mother of 2 who recently just took in my Brother and his family (wife &amp; son). My brother was in the USMC and got out early due to medical issues and we figured we could make it work, but unfortunatly due to the economy he has had a difficult time finding a new job and we are all trying to survive on my salary alone. He did take AND pass his postal exam yesterday so please pray for us that this leads to something great. If anyone could find it in their hearts to help us out a little it would be greatly appreciated.also if you need any other information in regards to this situation or would like a verification code please message me.
Thank you for taking the time to read this &amp; God Bless
