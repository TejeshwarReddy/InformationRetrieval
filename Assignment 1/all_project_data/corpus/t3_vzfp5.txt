Hey, everyone. I've been having a tough time lately. My bank account is pretty low, I can screenshot it if needed. The paycheck from the job I had to leave is late showing up in the mail. I'm a lot more fortunate than some people here, but I'm stuck in this spot right now. I would be so so so thankful if someone from this amazing community could help out. Pizza is great.
