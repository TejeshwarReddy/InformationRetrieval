So, my husband and I decided to get separated on Saturday. It's amicable, but still incredibly sad. On top of that, I am ill in bed with the worst cold I've had in years and have been basically drifting in and out of sleep for the last 24 hours, with brief breaks for a drink warm water. I don't have any energy to cook.

I can't say I'm desperate for a pie, but having one delivered to my door would be absolutely awesome. Thanks!
