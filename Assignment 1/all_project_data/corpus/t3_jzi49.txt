Hi! So I found out about this pretty cool idea while surfing the web. There were a lot of stories about needy college students so I thought someone out there could help me. It's my second week of classes and the food here is just horrible. My roommate and I have been trying to get some decent food but cash is so tight with books/fees. Scholarship money doesn't come in for at least another week. HELP US PLEASE!

We found a coupon to get a large pizza and cheesesticks for $10 from pizza hut. We have promised each other to do this for someone else once our checks get in. Thanks for considering us!
