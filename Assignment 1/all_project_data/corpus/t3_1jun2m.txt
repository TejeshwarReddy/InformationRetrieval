So spice up my life with a pizza! Broke, it ain't no joke, my landlord wants to get payed, and my stomach wants something other then peanut butter. Figured I would try to get a treat before I sell my laptop!

Thanks, yo.

And feel free to mail me smokes, hardyhar, haven't had one since last Thursday.. but, hell, might as well just quit.
