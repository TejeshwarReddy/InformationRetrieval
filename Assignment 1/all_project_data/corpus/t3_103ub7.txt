Financial Aid ran out a few month's back, been borrowing money and selling everything I own just to make ends meet. Not trying to give you a sob story cause life isn't all that bad, I mean hey I graduate next month and Im healthy so im pretty happy about that. I just wish I could afford something to eat, let alone a pizza. Thank you for listening
