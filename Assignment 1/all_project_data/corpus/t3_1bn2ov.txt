Been donating plasma twice a week for extra cash. Couldn't donate on Tuesday because the nurse fucked up my left arm on Saturday, and I was told I would need BOTH arms available to donate. So they sent me home. I can't go back until the blood on the surface of my skin disperses. A pizza would really help out for Thursday and Friday, if someone would be kind enough. It's not much, but I could repay you with reddit gold upon my next donation.
