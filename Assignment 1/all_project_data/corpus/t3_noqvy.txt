I've been dating my boyfriend for three years now. We've been through a LOT, mostly due to my health. I asked for him to take time off of work last year to accompany me to my many appointments and he gladly did so. I am cancer free these days, have been in remission for six months and working two jobs of my own to pick up the slack on medical bills in collections... but he's doing nothing. I feel like a total asshole for expecting him to when I specifically asked him to take time off from his job, but I can't afford to keep both of us afloat anymore. He went home to see his family, but I'm unable to fly, so I'll be spending Christmas alone. I don't want him to see this, so I'm on a throwaway. :\ It'd be great to wallow in my holiday weekend and munch on some pizza for Christmas... I will pay this forward.
