My friend, also a redditor, and I have been homeless for the last few weeks together. We have been having to shoplift what food we can and we've begged change. We have a steady location for the next 24 hours or so.

Anyone out there that can help us out? It would be greatly appreciated. We've been surviving on next to nothing for the past week.

Thanks.
