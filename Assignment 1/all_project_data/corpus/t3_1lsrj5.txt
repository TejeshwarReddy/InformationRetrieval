Been a bad week, My birthday was followed by my SO getting arrested for being in the wrong place at the really wrong time. I spent 18 hours not having a clue where he was. Court yesterday to find out that he's being charged with something he wasn't involved in and had no idea was  going on. Just would love some pizza to pick up my spirits
