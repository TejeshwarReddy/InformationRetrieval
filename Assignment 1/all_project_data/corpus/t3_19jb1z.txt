My friend and I's flight was canceled, and then delayed we're stuck here intill 7:30 PM and won't get to our final destination till 10. We've been here since 8:00AM. The airport is super tiny, there isn't any place to grab food. A pizza would be super clutch right now! 

our flight has been delayed again, and we're still hungry, please!
