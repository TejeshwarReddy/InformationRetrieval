Nothing special here really, Poked my head into RAoP when it first started thought its a pretty cool idea.  There ARE other redditors who NEED such a service more than myself, but hey, its free pizza right? =p

If anyone is in the mood for giving feel free to drop me a PM, I live in a rural town with no large pizza franchises, so I'm not sure how that would even work &gt;_&lt;

Cheers all!
