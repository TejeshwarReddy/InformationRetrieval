My girlfriend and I moved out to Longmont, Colorado just under a month ago primarily for school and while my work transfered me (Starbucks), the lack of hours while moving in combination with other factors has left us with nothing but cornbread until Monday. My girlfriend has gone to the coffee shop to apply for scholarships in peace and I would love to be able to fill her tummy with surprise pizza upon her return. I promise to pay it forward.
