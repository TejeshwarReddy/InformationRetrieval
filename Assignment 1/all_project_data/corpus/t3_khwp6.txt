Hey, folks. I'd really hate to ask for any assistance from anyone, especially since there are more needy people out there, but we've kind of hit a snag and could really use the help.

Here's the deal: I'm 22, and I live with my mom. We've been going through some pretty rough times as of late -- we're knee deep in debt, going through a foreclosure on our home, and we've been living paycheck to paycheck for months on end. Mom works part-time at a hospital, and I've been looking for work for quite awhile, but as of yet nothing's come up. We've been living on what food my mom can get from her work (employees can get food in exchange for 'payroll reduction', where they take the charges right out of their paycheck), but this week's pay cycle just ran out, meaning we can't get any more food there until this coming week. Groceries haven't been a realistic possibility with our income lately, so until then, we're out of luck (and food) this weekend. We've got twenty dollars in the bank to cover gas, but that's about it.

In addition to all of this, my mom suffers from a myriad of health issues, so between that and all of the stress from our financial situation, she feels absolutely miserable. I'm hoping that maybe some delicious pizza would at least take her mind off things and brighten up her day a bit.  Again, I feel awful asking for help,  but any at all would be greatly appreciated, and when we can afford it, we will definitely be able donate a pizza or two here.
