I guess my situation is pretty typical. I'm unemployed and in school and trying to make every cent last as long as possible. That means a diet of mac and cheese, sandwiches, ramen, and cereal. Prepared foods like pizza are luxuries that I haven't been able to afford in a very long time. It's eight bucks for one lunch at a Chinese restaurant, or eight bucks to buy bread and meat for sandwiches that week. So if anyone has a spare pizza lying around I'd be grateful for it.
