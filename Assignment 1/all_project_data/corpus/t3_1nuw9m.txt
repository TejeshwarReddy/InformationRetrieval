Hey all, I running a bit low on funds and food right now, after paying rent and bills, and I don't get paid until later in the week.  Been eating oatmeal the past couple days, but a pizza could really help me out!

UPDATE: No longer needed, got pizza'ed by /u/anthylorrel over in /r/RandomActsOfPizza
