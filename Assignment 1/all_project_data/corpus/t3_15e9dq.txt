So the story is simple.  Due to a miscommunication with my family I will not be able to have Christmas dinner with them this year.  To top matters off my wife lost her debit card (with access to her cash) and I had a credit card payment (that I scheduled and forgot about) and a car insurance payment drop me into the red until payday this Friday.

So I'm feeling bummed and really could use a pie tonight if anyone is feeling generous.

Edit: Wifes debit card came in the mail last night so we are no longer broke.  Thanks for everyone who looked at this and thanks Styx9001 for the offer but things aren't looking quite as depressing as before!  Merry Christmas (or winter holiday of your choice!) ^.^
