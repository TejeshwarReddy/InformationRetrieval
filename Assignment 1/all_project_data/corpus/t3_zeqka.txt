I am in desperate need of food until I can finish training at my new job, which doesn't even start until the 14th. I have only $4 to my name, which I need for gas for when I start my job, as well as to find a white button up shirt at Goodwill. 

If anyone could help with a pie that could hold me over a few days, I'd be elated.
