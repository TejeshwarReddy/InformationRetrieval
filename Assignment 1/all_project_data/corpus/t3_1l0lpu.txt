Hi RAoP, my fiancée and I are both unemployed and are scraping along the moment with very little money. And since it is near the end of the month, we have even less.

It's a Saturday night and frankly we are starving! We don't have much/any food in the house we can eat, we live by ourselves and no family nearby that we can count on.

I know some people on here offer something small in exchange for the pizza (noticed one guy on here offered a rap xD), the only thing we can offer is really my fiancée might be able to do a little drawing for you (she's a good artist), or I can offer a spare copy of a game on Steam.

I know there are some good people out there on reddit and I hope one of them sees this.

I have 2 job interviews next week, if I get either of them, after my first pay I will come back on here and buy someone else in need a pizza. It's only fair.

Thank you and sorry for the slight wall of text.

Also, just in case, we are in the UK.
