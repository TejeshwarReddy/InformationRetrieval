I just moved to Winston-Salem from Jacksonville (NC) to start a new job, but I don't get my first paycheck until Friday. 

The process of moving has be financially tapped out (between my last rent payment in Jacksonville, and having to pay first month's rent and security deposit up here, all I have in the kitchen is a loaf of bread and PB &amp; J).

I have weighed the pro's and con's of sucking dick for a pepperoni pizza, but I thought I would try here first.
