Just been diagnosed with cancer for the second time at age 20. This is my last weekend of freedom before I have to go into hospital and lose all my hair and shit myself inside out for a week so I'd really appreciate a pizza. Before sending pizza I can provide proof (Even if you look over my profile from Oct 2011 to feb 2012 when I first got chemo) It's very easy to get pizza delivered online in Ireland btw. Thank you
