My Mom just returned from trying to buy groceries and believes she was robbed while she turned her back from her cart. About $200 was taken from her wallet and so now we're out that money and groceries from tonight. Salt on the wound is that, upon reflection, she realized a man had been shadowing her almost the whole time in an almost empty store and the store doesn't have video cameras.

My husband and I are down visiting, so it's 5 adults total. If you could spare enough for about 2 pizzas, you'd be doing us a great favor.
