I'm a single guy in my mid 20's living in California and I lost my job back in May. Two weeks after I lost my job I was diagnosed with Addison's Disease, an autoimmune disorder similar to Type 1 Diabetes but instead of insuline my body no longer produces cortisol as well as a few other hormones.

Most of the money I have left has been going to doctors and pharmacies to keep me healthy and I could really use some help keeping myself fed. I've been lurking on the sight for a while and finally worked up the courage to ask for some help.

If anyone out there could help out I'd return the favor as soon as I could and would be forever thankful.
