Well, I finished up college and I'm back home now, unemployed, and the whole house is going through a really rough time. Little to no food, hard to pay bills, hardly even any toilet paper. I've never been one to ask for things really, and I don't even want to now, but it's gotten to the point where it's sort've needed. I'm headed to the food bank at a local church in hopes of getting some food, but I just figured this would be worth a shot.  

  
I don't really expect anything, but it'd be awesome if something did happen.  
  

I don't particularly have any skills... or else I'd draw some pictures or some shit. But I do have $5 on my Steam Account, so if someone would like, I'll gift them a game? Idk.
