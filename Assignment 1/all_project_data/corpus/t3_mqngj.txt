I know I've been helped before but I've gotten into this situation again and I'm extremely stressed out. I have no job right now and I'm sick of Ramen.

I would really appreciate it if someone could lessen my burden here by cheering me up a bit and I promise I'd be able to pay it forward!

Thank you!
