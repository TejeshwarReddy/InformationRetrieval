Hello amazing do-gooders of Reddit!

I'm 26, and graduating with my B.S. in 31 days. I busted my ass off to get a special grant from the state this year so that I could afford to finish my final year of my undergraduate degree. Each semester this is $2500, and really it just helps me pay rent and utilities. (My mom passed away a year ago, and my father is currently squatting in house in the Appalachians somewhere. I literally have nowhere to go if I can't afford a place to live.)

Well, I am still waiting on the grant money for this semester. My case worker contacted me 10 days ago saying she had just caught something she missed, and I should expect the school to receive payment in "a few weeks"... And I'm still waiting.

Thankfully I just got a part time job working 12-10 sat &amp; sun. But my first paycheck is largely going to pay my recently increased Comcast bill and my cellphone, which I haven't had on since March 22. My birthday was on March 27, and I didn't get a single present or phone call because I can't pay my phone bill. I am behind on my rent. I've been surviving off of 1-2 packets of ramen a day for the past 3 weeks. 

I could really just use a hug... or an internet hug in the form of a pizza...

And fully plan on pizza-ing someone the second I can afford to.
