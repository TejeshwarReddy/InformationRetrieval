It feels weird and kind of crappy to ask for help over the internet but I'm broke and tired of eating white rice. Its all I have for food until I get paid next Thursday. A pizza sounds delicious right about now.

I live alone and my summer job is winding down. I tried to save money knowing this transitional time between my summer/winter jobs was coming but its just one thing after another, leaving me where I am now - eating rice and nearly broke (if $1.50 in quarters counts as having money). This week and the next are probably the worst I'm going to have it. I just want something hot to eat that isn't rice.

Can provide pics of my kitchen as proof, even my paperwork for a food stamp application if it helps.

Happy holidays everyone

Edit: [Pizza came](http://i.imgur.com/SC3RC.jpg). Wish I could put into words how grateful I am and how unexpected it was to see not 1, but 4 pizzas come..this will last me a while. Thank you. I'm not even sure what else to say besides thank you a hundred times. This is the nicest thing anyone has done for me in quite some time.
