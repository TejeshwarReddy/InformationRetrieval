I'm a college grad living in NYC. Interning to keep my feet in the business, freelancing and dog walking when I'm not interning. The money I made this month is just enough to keep a roof over my head and my heat kept on.  I have no food, having eaten down what's left of my pantry over the course of the month. I've had nothing to eat but condiments for the last two days. I woke up this morning with a splitting headache and cramps in my feet. Anything you could give is appreciated! If this doesn't work, I'm going to try begging for food (not money) on the train.  I really don't want it to come to that...

**EDIT:** Thank you so much to @SallyMacLennane for gifting me with food today.  It was amazing and I will have left overs to last me through the weekend!  THANK YOU to everyone who upvoted and @m2mu for the soup kitchen advice!  Many best wishes this Thanksgiving!!
