I have my reddit account for a while, I have participated in RedditGifts and even bought a redditor pizza once  just short on cash and really have a craving for pizza.  I would gladly buy you pizza when i get paid. 

EDIT:
I GOT SOME PIZZA!!! A Friend of mine who also reddits noticed my post and sent domino's over.  Thank you for all the offers. You are all really awesome!  if anyone needs some pizza next week when i get paid, feel free to PM me.
