After a few very nerve-racking days, my uterus finally kicked into gear today, and despite the bleeding, gut-wrenching cramps, and splitting headache I feel the triumphant relief of knowing that my birth control pill functioned as it was supposed to, that I am not pregnant, and that my boyfriend and I do not have a crisis on our hands.

We're at home today, me downing tylenol for the pain and him trying his adorable best to keep the mood swings at bay. We'd totally appreciate pizza as we celebrate the cycle of womanhood, the invention of birth control pills, and the fact that our few sexytimes-sans-condom this past month did not end in procreation.

Thanks for your time and consideration, and I hope that this post isn't too NSFW in content/attitude for this board - I had to inject some humor into the situation to alleviate some of the prior stress of it. :)
