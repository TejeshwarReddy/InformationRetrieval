Waiting for payday a few days away and due to bills being a bit higher then expected having to live off pb and j until pay day. Would love to share a pizza or two with family to have something else on our taste buds til then. Would be more then happy to return the favor after payday, and as much as I hate asking for help would love to lift our spirits up a bit! Thanks in advance!
