I'm not going to come up with some sob story, I'm not going to make you feel bad for me. 
I'm a guy at work, hungry for pizza, and have no cash. I packed a lunch, but I dropped it on the floor and now am underfed. Not like I'm starving or anything, I had a few snacks. I would just really like a small pizza. 

Any takers for an honest hungry guy?
