So I'm a broke college student (big surprise!) who couldn't go home for Thanksgiving. All my housemates went home, and all my friends went home as well/had other plans, so it looks like I'm spending the next 4 days alone. I would really appreciate not having to eat mac&amp;cheese for the umpteenth time, especially on this day.
