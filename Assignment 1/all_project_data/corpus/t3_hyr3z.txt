Im from Louisiana and I've just currently obtained a part-time job after being laid off for months with no expected pay until 15 days.  Been trying for many weeks with social services to obtain SNAP assistance (food stamps) and after my initial interview I managed to contact the SS office.  I was told my case was accepted and my card was on it's way; it never reached my mailbox.  I'm on the phone every morning trying to get through to my caseworker to no avail. 

I've used up my borrowing resources to amend with bills and I'm running out of options until payday.  Any help would really be appreciated and certainly not forgotten.  I will return the favor to the user and/or the community; whichever preferred, and if not thanks for taking the time out to read this.
