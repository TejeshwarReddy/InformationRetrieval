As it says, I have no job.  My diet for the last few weeks has consisted of ramen, cheese, mayo, deli meat and bread. 

I can give you the sob story if you want, but i'm not going to put it here. Basically unemployed for the last 2 months, and no money.  I have 2 interviews set up tomorrow, and hopefully one of those will pan out.  

This is a throwaway due to the fact that friends use reddit and know me.  I have a lot of humility, and I never ask anyone for help. I can verify that I am in fact a redditor (13 mo) and will return this favor to some other deserving candidate when I get the job tomorrow (because i'm going to get it of course).

Thanks.
