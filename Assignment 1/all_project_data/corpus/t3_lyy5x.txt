My gf is going through a slew of pretty serious shit. Some of it could be considered extreme first world problems (got in trouble with the law for something anyone could get in trouble for), as well as dealing with more severe troubles (ailing family member). 

No she isn't homeless, poor, etc., but I thought I'd write this request anyway.  Today is a big day for her, one that determines the consequences of her immediate future. It would be nice if she could come home to a free pizza, and to the knowledge that a random stranger decided to do that for her. She's vegetarian btw.
