Sitting here at home with the flu and a fever and in desperate need of carbs to fuel myself. Been on the keto diet for a while and have none in my house whatsoever. :/ Payday was yesterday (Tuesday) but since I've been sick, I haven't been able to leave the house to pick up my check! Just got PizzaHut around here and I'm so hungry right now it all looks good to me lol.
