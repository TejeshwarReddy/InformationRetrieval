You know how it is - end of the month, all the money's been committed, stuck at work and everyone else is eating awesome lunch stuff and you've got nothing but the earlier resolve to just drink water at lunch until payday...which is seeming less satisfying by the minute.

If granted a joyful pizza, I'll be offering a pizza on the 16th in return, because that's how I (pizza) roll.

ETA: whether today, tomorrow, or Wednesday, doesn't matter. I'll be working through lunch, so time is also flexible (say...by 3pm on any of those days). Thanks for your consideration!
