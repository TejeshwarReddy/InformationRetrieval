I don't know much about random acts of pizza, so I'm not sure if it is okay to request pizza on behalf of a random redditor I don't know.  I'm really sorry if I'm doing it wrong, but I saw his comic and remembered you: http://i.imgur.com/DZb4a.png

(Let me know if I shouldn't have this up here, and I'll delete it.)
Edit: Oops.  That should be r/atheism in the title. I'm posting before 6 AM and not my sharpest.
