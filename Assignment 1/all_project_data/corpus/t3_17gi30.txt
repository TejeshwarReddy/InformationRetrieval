Fiance was laid off a month or so ago so money was already tight before we had frozen pipes burst in our basement a week ago.


Our idiot landlord is dragging his feet on getting things fixed. We haven't showered in days, and have no more clean dishes to eat or cook anything on/in.

If somebody would be kind enough to order us some pizza, we would gladly pass it forward when our taxes come back.  There is a Pizza Hut and a Dominos nearby.

I also posted on the other RAOP.  That isn't against the rules is it?
