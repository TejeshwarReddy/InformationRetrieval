Hi guys,

I'm pretty much out of money (and food, been eating fish sticks) until the first of January, when paycheck comes out. I can spot some other hungry people when I get paid, I have no way of proving that, but just take my word for it and hassle me if your so kind to give me some pizza :). Assuming a tornado doesn't blow up my house tonight, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks guys!
