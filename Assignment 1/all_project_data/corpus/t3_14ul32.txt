I'm quitting my job in IT to focus on my last semester of college and a career in music management, which is what I've been going to school for. Since I'll just be doing internships next semester, I really need to save my money. And of course I leave my lunch at home today. 

I just discovered this subreddit last week and will definitely pay it forward as soon as I have some spare cash. Thanks and have a good weekend!
