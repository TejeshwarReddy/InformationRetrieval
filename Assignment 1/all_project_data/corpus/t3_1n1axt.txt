I switched careers recently and won't be able to eat this week. It takes a lot for me to even ask here.

*Edit- I'm a bouncer now! Now if only I could eat enough to look like one. It's such a perfect job for me. All I've ever wanted to be is a ninja, and this fits so well. Do you have any idea how many calories sparring, weightlifting, parkour (ing) requires? Squirrels are not bulky.
