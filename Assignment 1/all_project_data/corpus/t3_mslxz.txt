First timer!

I saw the post from that guy saying he was leaving because of all the sad stories. I think the "half-full or half-empty" rule applies here.
You can see sad stories, or joy from getting help from a stranger!

Also, I will try my luck! It is not in the intention of feeding kids. I'm just a random guy that just moved to Montr√©al, QC. My delicious "flour-water-salt" pancakes got the job done for a few days. But now I think i need some fat in my belly :\ 

It will be paid forward before the holidays!


I will now leave you with this: 

* 3 billion pizzas are sold annually, that's 46 slices each for every man, woman and child in the country.

Do you eat 46 slices every year ?
