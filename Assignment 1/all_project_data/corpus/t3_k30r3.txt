I'm making a pit-stop in Denver right now and am staying at a friend's house, so delivery pizza is a possibility for me for the first time in about 2 months. Also yesterday was my 24th birthday and all I ate was ramen and a pack of oatmeal. If you buy me pizza it will be obvious to everyone that you are cooler than a pack of peas :D.
