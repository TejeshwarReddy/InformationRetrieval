Lost my Job three months ago. Since then I've bought nothing but pasta. I got told today that all I need to do is go down tomorrow to fill out paperwork to get setup, but today I have 3 dollars in my bank. Anyone wanna buy a pizza for a guy to celebrate with something other than water and beef top ramen since I won't be paid for another 3 weeks yet?
