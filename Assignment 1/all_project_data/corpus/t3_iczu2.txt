I read an article about this website and can't believe you guys. I am a neuroscience student and prep cook and have been pretty down on my luck lately. I would love it if someone who isn't financially strained could help me out. I have less than twenty dollars to spend on food until the 15th if I plan on making rent. Considering moving out and camping in the woods for the rest of the summer. Fingers crossed.
