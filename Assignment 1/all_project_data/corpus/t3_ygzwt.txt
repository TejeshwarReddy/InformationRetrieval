I'm broke until the 28th and I wanted to make her birthday special this year because last year was the day she found out my dad had a new girlfriend. :\ Anyway, basically, my mom deserves a good day to relax and since we can't throw her a little party, we're hoping to get some pizza from either of her favorite places. Boston Pizza or East Side Mario's.

Edit: Pizza for my mom, brother, and I. (Edit 2: cleaned up the post.)
