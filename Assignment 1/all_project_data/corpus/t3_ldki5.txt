I'm a 20 year old college kid in East Tennessee who works retail but doesn't get nearly enough hours. I'm out of money until Wednesday and seeing how I have never tried this subreddit out, I figured it couldn't hurt to join this community if I will be accepted. I promise to pay it forward later on in the week when I get paid! I hope you guys can make my night since I'm home alone on a Saturday, haha.
