So yesterday I had a really rubbish day - feeling poorly, clients being awful and generally things not going too well. I got home to find my car with a parking ticket because the council put the wrong license plate number on my permit which I hadn't noticed (and I'm a learner so I couldn't move the car), then today I got hit with a load of bank charges for stuff from August, when I was already worrying how I would get through to payday this month because of a bunch of unexpected payments. I have enough in my account for my phone bill, and maybe enough food in cupboard/freezer to manage my meals til payday. I am feeling pretty crap and I'm stuck at work wishing I was under my duvet. Does anyone feel like making my day and gifting me a pizza before I commit to three weeks of beans on toast?

I'll be in a better situation after payday I promise to either repay anyone who would be kind enough to help, or gift someone next month. 

Thanks for reading!
