I'm not gonna bore y'all with some long sob story, but basically it's gonna be a looong loooong time before I can afford a pizza again, and maybe I'm just cynical but I think it's amazing people would be so generous and when I've got a bit of cash I look forward to being able to make someones day.  So if anyone would be so kind to send me a wee pizza over, I would be so thrilled :)
