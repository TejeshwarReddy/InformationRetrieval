I have posted in the food pantry to try and get some help for my mom and brothers, but I am asking if anyone could get them a pizza or two, they ran out of the food I gave them to eat while on a bus back to El Paso, yes, it wasn't much, but I was able to get them each a protein bar and a water for the trip, but money is so tight I am struggling myself but this is not for me just them please, they are my only concern.
Mom and my brothers are good people but they fell on hard times and I didn't have the money to come home with them yet
I know a pizza by itself won't solve their problems, but after a 24 hour bus trip from my home in California back to moms home in Texas, it would be a blessing and I am trying so hard to find a way to help them, I miss them so damn much.
Well it is most likely too late to get a pizza for them this evening, but I still have faith, i talked to them and that made me happy, just wish i could do more right now.
Please help me if you can. Nicole
