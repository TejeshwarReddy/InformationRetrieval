I'm supposed to go home in two weeks (Europe) and I lost my credit card on Tuesday. I'm working on getting it back but it's going to take a couple of days. Haven't eaten anything but spaghetti with pepper the last two days so if anyone is feeling like buying me a pizza I promise to return the favor when I get my card back!

Edit: I got a gift card for a couple of pizzas! Reddit you're amazing!
