I'm 21 years old, just got out of a bad relationship and we have a 17 month old. I just moved in with my friend until I get my feet on the ground, I don't get paid until next Friday and I'm more than willing to help someone else out as soon as my funds allow me. I've never been in such a shitty situation, and I don't know what to do. I'm hungry and reaching out to you redditors
