I've got finals for summer semester this week, and I'm spending everyday until Tuesday holed up in my room with my books. Pizza would be greatly appreciated. Help me make good grades! 

After my finals are over, I'll make you some kind of present to say thanks. I don't know what it'll be, but I do know it'll be awesome.
