Vermont

So I've never posted here, and I feel like I'm begging so I need to level and say that I do have food in the house. I just haven't had much of anything besides pasta and ground beef for a few weeks (the ground beef ran out a few days ago, so I'm kind of stuck with just pasta for the next few days, until I receive my check in the mail.)

Figured I'd test my luck and see if I can't switch it up and have some pizza this afternoon. If anyone might be up for the favor you can send me a pm.

edit: Pizza received! Thanks a bunch.
