Throwing myself at your feet, oh charitable redditors. 

There is nothing special about my circumstances.  I am tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt, 3 months out of school with not even fast food franchises hiring me.  My food outlook tonight is bleak, and instead of mooching my roommate's little bit of groceries for the umpteenth time, I'd like to instead surprise her with pizza. 

The day I get an actual paycheck I will pay it forward
