Now, I'm not poor, per se. Yes, there's currently $5 in my bank account total, but I'm not wanting for food. I stocked up at the store and I have enough to eat.

That being said, I'm sick of it. Everything I have is based on sandwiches. Ham on wheat. Eggs on wheat. Peanut butter and jelly... on wheat.

I've got enough food and I don't have a particularly rough life, so I'd hate to argue for the front of the queue of this font of generosity, but...

... if anyone wants to help me have a hot delicious meal as opposed to an acceptable room temperature meal... it'd lift my spirits.

Thank you very much for your consideration.
