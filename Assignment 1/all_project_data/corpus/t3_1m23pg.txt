Hi there, wonderful strangers.
We've been having a pretty rough time recently and are frighteningly low on food. The wife and I can live of off bread for another night, but I really need to get something substantial into my two girls (2 and 3 years old). I just started a new job at one of the million local call-centers and will be getting my first paycheck this Friday. 

I'm hoping someone will be willing to send us some pizza and I will pay it back and/or forward on friday.

^This is my 3-year- showing off that she know's who you're gonna call.

Please help make some magic happen for my family.
