Hello, I had a friend direct me to this when he couldn't help me with any cash. I'm basically awaiting on my financial aid that hasn't came in yet. My bank account has been in the red for 3 weeks now and I've been eating water with Bisquick pancake mix. I'm just trying to get by until middle of next week with my Aid will come in, though I can tell my unhealthy diet hasn't been the best. I don't know how this subreddit works but any pizza would make me so happy. I will gladly return the favor when my aid gets in. My parents or friends can't afford to get my back account black again so it's a shitty situation.

I'm from Grand Forks, ND btw!
