It's been decided in federal court that Occupy Cleveland has a right to assemble! Yay!

I'm humbly requesting that maybe some folks could pitch in for pizza. We're at the Tom Johnson Park in Public Square, downtown Cleveland. We LOVE pizza. Well, really, we love any hot food, but pizza tops it all. :) Most of all, we love support! Thank you, reddit.

By the way, my name is Rachel. I am not currently downtown, but I can give any proof needed (aside from a phone call, because I don't have a phone) to show that I'm real. :) I'll be heading downtown sometime soon for our daily General Assembly.
