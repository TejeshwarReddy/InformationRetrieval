sorry if the title seems quite melodramatic. In all honesty it has been pretty bad for me. Was dating the girl of my dreams, and I made a decision that was pretty big and had quite a large impact on my life for the better. She was in full support of this decision throughout the relationship until one day she came home and told me she needed to call it off and she couldn't handle it anymore. Less than 2 weeks later she is dating someone else, and its now been less than 2 months, and she is getting married to him. This breaks my damn heart. All my money has been getting dumped into her before all this, and since I am on disability I didn't have a whole lot to begin with. She kind of ruined me financially and emotionally. I actually just spent the last of my money on my car insurance the other day. On top of all of this everyone in my social circle have all just stopped talking to me for reasons they wont explain. I have literally been sitting in my room alone for days on end.  I REALLY hope this doesn't come off as too much of a sappy story, but in all honesty, I don't really care if I actually get a pizza out of this story or not. I just wanted to be able to tell my story and hoped that someone cared enough to listen.
