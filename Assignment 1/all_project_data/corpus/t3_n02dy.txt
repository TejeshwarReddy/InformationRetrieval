'Sright. In exchange for sending me pizza, I will do my damnedest to draw your likeness on my own body. With a sharpie.

No, I'm not out of cash, I'm not grieving a loss, and I'm certainly not craving vegetables (you thought those jokes were over, didn't you?). Just looking to be part of something entertaining.

Notes: I'm NOT an art student. I'm not even very good at drawing. But I'm still going to do everything in my power to draw my very best for you. Also: you could request your favorite animal if you don't like the idea of your face drawn on some stranger somewhere.

Please also note where you'd like me to draw. Before you do, however, contort yourself and see if you could accurately draw on that part of yourself. If you can't: I can't.

Let's have some Sunday fun, shall we?
