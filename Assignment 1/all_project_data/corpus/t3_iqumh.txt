i received once before from raop and i thank you, but i seem to have found myself at your mercy once again. up till Wednesday i had bout $30 to get me till payday. found out the hard way that businesses have up to a year to actually collect funds from a card purchase. it almost over-drafted my account but thankfully took some from my savings luckily saving me from a fee but also draining that as well. i am by no means probably the neediest person here, but today was another horrid day at my dead end job and some pizza love or hell even some kind words would help my mood. Again thank you all you everything you do here.
