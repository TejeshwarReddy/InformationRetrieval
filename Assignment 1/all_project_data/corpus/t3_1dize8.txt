So my new boss (I work at a math tooterin' center) messed up adding me to the payroll and I don't get paid til next Friday.  I spent the last of my money yesterday by ordering an eggroll for pickup with the last ~$2 in my bank account then buying veggie fried rice with my last $4 in change when I went to get it (real sneaky sorta cept I shoulda just bought ramen/cheap groceries).  I'm seeing my family this weekend so they'll definitely feed me, but til then it's not looking good.  


I'm not gonna link to the music cause I don't want this to come off like a sneaky promo, but if you want to hear it and you message me I won't turn you down
