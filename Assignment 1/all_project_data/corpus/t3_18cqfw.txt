I feel like shit to even have to ask. i've been out of a job for a while (too long) and we live off of a single disability cheque for 2 ppl (940 a month or so) most of the time we can make it work, this month due to some unforeseen expenses we're about a week short, We're not gonna starve because we've basically rationed what we have, but we couple prob stretch a single pizza into a couple days of meals. Figured worst case this post gets ignored so may as well try, thanks to all you wonderful people either way!
