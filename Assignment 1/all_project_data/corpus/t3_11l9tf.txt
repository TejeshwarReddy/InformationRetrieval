My friend told me about this sense things have been a little tight lately due to a separation between me and my wife, enough sob story(herd you guys aren't big on those) but i would love to surprise my daughter tonight with her favorite a bacon and jalapeno  pizza while we watch nightmare before Christmas.  So if someone would be kind enough to help in my attempt to keep her mind off her me and her mother i would be more then happy.  And i will be sure to help someone else when i get paid on Friday.  Thank you all for being awesome!
