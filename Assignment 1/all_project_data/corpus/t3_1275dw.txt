I take a pill form of Chemotherapy for my Leukemia (cml) and I have absolutely no food that is gonna sit in my stomach and be enough besides an expired mini bag of pretzels. I would really appreciate a pizza. From anywhere. I know places close soon so this is really my last option for food tonight.
