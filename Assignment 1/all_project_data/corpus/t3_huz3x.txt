That's about it, I suppose. My wife fortunately makes enough for us to scrape by but treats are rare these days.

EDIT: ~~I PMed azzip_oAR as requested and sent him my email. He says he sent me a Dominoes gift thingy via e-mail but that was 30 minutes ago and it hasn't showed up in my inbox, should it take that long?~~

EDIT2: [YES, IT SOMETIMES TAKES AWHILE.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/huz3x/request_laid_off_for_a_few_months_now_not/c1ylhbj) 

Thanks to azzip_oAR and everyone else here, this rocks.
