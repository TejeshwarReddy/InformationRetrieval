Recently kicked out of my apartment that I was sharing with a friend, now staying at my parent's house but they are out of town for a while and have cleared out the house of any food until they get back. Would love some pizza to hold me over for a day or two! 

In Scottsdale, Arizona if that means anything.

Thanks, love you all &lt;3
