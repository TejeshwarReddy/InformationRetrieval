I'm watching my grandparent's house for the next few days and I have absolutely NO money and there isn't any food in the house. I've eaten all the cereal and applesauce in the house and would really appreciate it if someone could help me out with a RAOP. I will gladly trade pictures of my cat and/or my nephew for your karma pleasure.

**EDIT** Once my grandparents pay me I promise to pay it forward/back.
