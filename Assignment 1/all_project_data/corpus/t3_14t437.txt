I'm 15 weeks pregnant with my very first little munchkin and I am just going *nuts* for anything salty and savory. Unfortunately, my SO and I have committed to making all our food at home with whatever we have on hand (to save up for this baby of ours). None of the ingredients we have include pizza ingredients. But we *do* have an abundance of peanut butter, jelly, and bread which is the exact opposite of what I've been craving. We don't know if it's a girl or a boy yet (we know in 8 days!), but an old wives' tale says that if you're craving sweets it's a girl, but if you're craving salty things it's a boy :)
