Howdy everyone! You doin' alright? 

This is my first post, and I'm not sure if I'm doin' this right (oh please correct me if I'm doing it wrong!) but here goes, here's why I wish I had a pizza right now (prepare for dramalama): 

**The worst:** I just had to tell this girl, the sweetest, funnest, cutest one you could ever imagine, that I didn't feel the same way about her that she did about me. Yes, I would sing her praises yet don't reciprocate, why? I've known her since we were kids, and since we've grown up, I absolutely can't see her as anything more than a little sister. She's never been quite lucky in love, and every fiber of my being knows she deserves more than a "no" from anyone, yet I can't be the one to do it -- I would be lying to myself and to her. Uggghhh, seeing her in this state, and knowing I caused it, is really taking it's toll on me. I've been dreaming about her, and even in my dreams I can't feel the same way, making me wake up only an hour or two into my sleep and unable to go back to sleep due to feeling so miserable. 

**The kind-of okay:** Aside from that, I simply don't have any food in the house right now, and my only ride out of this mountainous region isn't coming until (hopefully?) tomorrow, so that I may go get groceries. 

So, not having pizza in a long-ass time, I feel like one would definitely bring an umbrella to this raincloud party, as well as tie me over until my friend gets back up here. What say you, friend?
