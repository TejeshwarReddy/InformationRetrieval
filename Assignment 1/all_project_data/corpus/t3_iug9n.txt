Finally created an account on reddit for this post alone, basically the situation is that I was paid on friday, and my bank (Arizona Federal Credit Union) has placed a hold my payroll check for a couple of days now. I was told that it would be included in my "available balance" 6pm MST, however it has still not shown up. The banks are now closed, my account in still negative, and I am stuck at work till 11 pm. I was counting on ordering something once the funds were available, but alas I will be hungry tonight. Unless there is a kind soul out there who responds to this message. 

P.S. - This is the first time I have done something like this, and would love to repay the favor for someone tomorrow. Its a lot easier on my conscious if I consider this a loan, rather than a freebie. Thanks again!
