Every other paycheck goes almost entirely to rent for my studio apartment in the city. The leftover cash went straight to bag of food for the pup- the light of my world.
I could sure use a pizza though.. Not even a box of noodles in the pantry. I would sure appreciate it :) and I can return the favor on the 15th or later!
