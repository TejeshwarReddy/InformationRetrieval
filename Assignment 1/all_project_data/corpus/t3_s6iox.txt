In between paychecks. Would be awesome to eat Dinner, Lunch, or Breakfast once this week. If you're in the giving mood PM me or comment. DFW area. All and any help appreciated. I plan on returning the favor the second I get my paycheck and will post proof. 

Again Thanks all. I'd just like to say this subreddit is beyond awesome, and thank you to anyone and everyone who has been so kind.
