Hello, right now I have my newborn daughter in my left arm as I type this with my right. If released even for a moment she will start screaming very loudly for a twelve-day-old person. 

I would like to humbly submit my request for a free pizza. Cooking a meal has been...difficult shall we say and both my wife and I are very tired of Ramen Noodles and Lean Cuisine.

I know Papa John's has a deal this weekend but Dominos is the only place that delivers to my address in my area. 

Thank you in advance!
