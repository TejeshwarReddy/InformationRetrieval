First of all, I just wanted to say that I love pizza, more than life itself. It would make things just a little better, especially with how things are for us right now. 

Things have been spiraling downward lately. Me and my girlfriend were both laid off from our jobs, and since we had no money we were evicted from our apartment. We had friends willing to help us out, but they ALL told us at the last minute that they'd changed their minds. We ended up having to stay with my girlfriend's abusive parents (which was a nightmare in itself), and they decided to kick us out. On Christmas day nonetheless. 

We're staying with a friend now while we look for jobs. I'm not sure how long we can stay here even if we do get jobs, but I do know that having a pizza would make this whole mess a little more bearable.
