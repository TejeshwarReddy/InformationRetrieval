Since this is the interwebs and my sincere story could be nothing more than a grand facade to gain free grinds, I can offer nothing more than the hopeful ideation on your part that I am indeed in need of some savory cheesy, saucy laden goodness. I will save my sad-story for my own self when i cry myself to sleep tonight.

It will keep my recently low-spirits to rejuvenate in the fact that the world is not in fact filled with greedy corporate douche-bags who seek to crush me under their boot. Tomorrow is another day, but tonight a pizza will bring me temporary shelter from the bastards who seek to bring me down. or something.

In the hope of oven-baked goodness, I offer these haiku:

&gt; Stomach growling loud  
&gt; Oh, Random Acts of Pizza  
&gt; Deliver me hope  

&gt; ~~Hearken~~ my pizza prayer.  
&gt; Praise be to pepperoni!   
&gt; Never anchovy!  

ps. i'm in Honolulu and Pizza Hut is open late! :)

pss. it appears im a shitty haiku writer. dammit. :(

EDIT: Pizza received!
