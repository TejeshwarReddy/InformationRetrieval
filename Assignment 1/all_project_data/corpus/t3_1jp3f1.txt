My work laid me off and my funds are quite tight at the moment. I've been eating a spartan diet and would really appreciate a pie; it would make my week. I'm in Canada so I'm not sure if my location will muck up the works, but it can be done then I sure would appreciate it. Thanks in advance.

Edit: I'd like to cancel my request. 

I have a pal IRL that has spotted me some funds for a pie and even bought be some groceries. I'm touched by their kindness and look forward to paying it forward. 

I hope anyone that felt inclined to buy me a pie would invest their kindness somewhere else on this subreddit or IRL!
