Hi reddit. I'm a theatre major in Columbus and I'm wondering if someone could buy me a pizza. I've been working on a lot of projects and wrapping up the last week of summer classes and a greasy pizza is just the thing to kick start my night of work. To aid in my plea, I propose a trade! Here is a poem I have written for you, redditors of /r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza! Enjoy!

-ODE TO PIZZA-

Oh sauce, saucey sauce,

Tasting you makes me feel boss,

Spread you thick, long and wide,

Dick jokes are poem cyanide,

So let's talk pizza, with all that cheese,

Bread, butter. *Greeeaaaaassseeeeeeee*

On the rack, on the tray,

Pizza on pizza? So **deliciously** gay.

Mushrooms, peppers, onions and chives,

Get the fuck out, MEAT SAVES LIVES!

That was a pretty bad rhyme so I'll make it up to ya,

By ending this poem with an evil doll **"HOO-HA!"**

Zombies ate my neighbors y'aaaaalllll
