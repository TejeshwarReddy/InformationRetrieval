I've had a rough year, and am currently at a job where my boss criticizes me left and right because I'm not an aggressive enough salesperson, so I'm using all my resources to find other employment. I'm just a quiet person, and respect people too much to manipulate them into buying something. I know I hate it when it's done to me, so I couldn't do it to another person.

So I'm requesting a pizza to help relax and just unwind for the first time in this year. I absolutely intend to pizza it forward on payday.

Thank you.
