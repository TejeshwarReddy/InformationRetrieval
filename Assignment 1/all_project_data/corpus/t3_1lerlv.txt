No sob story. I am just hungry and would enjoy a pizza. I usually only eat organic, but, today I would like a pizza for lunch. I guess I should tell you  about myself! I am a 20 year old female in nursing school (I love it!) I am either going to be a flight nurse or psychiatric nurse. I also volunteer at the gift shop, at my local hospital, because I love to socialize and meet new people. If there is anything you would like to know about me, feel free to ask!
