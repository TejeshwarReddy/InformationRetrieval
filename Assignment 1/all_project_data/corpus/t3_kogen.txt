I hate asking for help from people but we really don't have a choice right now. I made a throwaway account since everyone living with me is a redditor and I'd like to surprise them. I'm in Minnesota,north of Minneapolis.  Edit-Completely out of food now. Me and the other guy let the 3 girls eat the rest of the ramen. We didn't get food sadly. So we're out of food and no one gets payed until Tuesday. Edit-Seems like no one can a help me out which sucks but there's nothing I can do about it. Congrats to everyone that asked and received today, you're lucky=)
