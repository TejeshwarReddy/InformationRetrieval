And I'm more than a little nervous right now because I'm doing a lot of job applications, getting a couple interviews for jobs, and really am in a tight spot money-wise, having been out of regular work for nearly ten months. Want to unwind this evening and a sudden urge for pizza goodness crept into my stomach.
