I am sitting here alone and bored this evening. Would be nice to spend it with a pizza. Just imagine the adventures the pizza and I  could go on, and once the adventuring is over the pizza will be devoured. But do not fret as the deed will be repaid to another poor pizza less soul, so they can also enjoy the greatness of the pizza.
