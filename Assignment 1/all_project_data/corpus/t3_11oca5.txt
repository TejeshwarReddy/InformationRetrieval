I have an 18 month old daughter and a 3 1/2 week old daughter. I am a single mother and my oldest daughter and I have a very tight bond bc I am the only person that has ever been constant in her life. I have been doing my best with trying to show her as much attention and affection as possible after having my second daughter but I can tell that my oldest daughter is having some problems adjusting to having to share my attention with her sister. My oldest daughter loves pizza...she gets so excited everytime we have pizza and she likes to eat all of the toppings and then the crust. She also likes to paint on her high chair with the pizza sauce lol!!! I would really like to have a mommy and daughter pizza and movie night but finances are really tight now that I am trying to learn how to budget for 3 people and 2 of them are in diapers. If anyone could help out and buy gift some pizza for my baby girl so I can give her a special fun night to help show her that mommy still loves her just as much as I ever have. I will definetly pay if forward and offer to gift someone else a pizza as soon as I financially can. Thank you!!!
