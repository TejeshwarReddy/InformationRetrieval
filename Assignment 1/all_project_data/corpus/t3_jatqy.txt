I'm a student and I'm a little low on cash for the next few days and would love a pizza right now. I promise to tell you at least one scientific fact about the physical world that makes you go "No! That's not true" even if it means I have to spend all night going through my stack of textbooks.

I spent all of my money doing [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/j7s3u/offer_anyone_need_anything_from_the_uk/). I was reimbursed via paypal but I stupidly made a transfer to my bank account so that money is lost in limbo for the next 2-3 working days. 

I've just come across this subreddit and I will be buying at least one pizza next week for someone independent of the outcome of this request. What you guys do here is awesome!
