so, yeah. im prayin someone finds it and gets a hold of me, til then, its just a waiting game i guess. im pretty pissed at myself. i have no cash whatsoever until thursday, i was supposed to go shopping tonight but that obviously isnt happening. we're basically out of food, my mother is bringin over some groceries tomorrow to hold us over for the week. can anyone help out for tonight? its for me and my 2 daughters. more than happy to take it as a loan and pay it back thursday. youd really be helping a ton. need verification/proof? ask away, many thanks
