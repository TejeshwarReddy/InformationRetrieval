Looking for someone to be really kind and buy a pizza or some food, within UK, not really bothered to what, as haven't eaten properly for the last few weeks and anything would be very much appreciated.

Been left with very little money this month thanks to unknowing bills popping up, and my boyfriends mobile company giving him an expensive bill of £56 compared to his usual £25.. So I've had to lend money I didn't really have to help save his ass. 

I'd/We'd be really grateful to any offers of any kind of food. Since we haven't ate much of anything for the last few weeks.

So I will say thank you in advance of any extra kind Redditors!! :D
