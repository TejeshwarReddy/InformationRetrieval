A good friend of mine from middle school passed away and I'm feeling awful. Normally I try to suck it up when it comes to how my scrimping and saving is affecting my groceries but fuck it, tonight I'm just not having it. Not tonight, probably not tomorrow night either. 

I just want to gorge myself on pizza. I know these posts are usually ignored but it at least helped to vent a bit. Still, I wish I could have one more hilarious, snarky and thoughtful conversation with my friend over pizza.
