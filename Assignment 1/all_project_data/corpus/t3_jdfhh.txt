Hello,

I've been wanting a pizza for a while and I don't really have much money. This isn't really a sob story though because I can eat something else but I'd love a pizza if someone can gift it.

Here are some random pics of my dog for people cause he's cool and encouraged me to want pizza: http://imgur.com/a/Vudjt

Also this is in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area) in Ontario. Any questions about this request are welcome :D

Anyways thanks RAOP and have a good day!
