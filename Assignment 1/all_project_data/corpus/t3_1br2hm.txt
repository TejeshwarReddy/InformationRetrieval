Had my phone stolen off me twice in two months, my insurance excess is pretty **ridiculous** and have had two teeth pulled earlier this year.
Money is really tight at the moment (due to insurance and whatnot ) and a pizza would really help alleviate a bit of that and make me feel allot better.

I have been pizza'd before through a private message and have done the same to someone who seemed depressed and jaded in a unrelated subreddit.
I now have to change my whole life/routine because of the fear off seeing the same bastards again.
They are fairly local and one of them was arrested for the robbery(hence retaliation).
Police couldn't give a **single fuck** anymore as they have someone arrested even though there are still 2 others out there and I'm getting threats.
[proof of crime][redacted]

**Edit!!** Not Starving!- Can get by without (have *just enough* money to survive), Just want cheer me up pizza, that's all
