Heya! I just recently moved from CA to Texas for school and it's left me pretty broke. Living with my aunt, but we have no groceries in the house and I'm going to be alone all weekend by myself. I don't like taking things for free, and I won't have any money to pay it forward for a week or two. So if I get a pizza I'll [play it forward](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/) and give away 3 games that are in my inventory. I probably won't get the pizza until tomorrow sometime to hold me over until Sunday. Thanks all! Any other questions just ask. :)

Edit: Guess I should mention that I'm in Edinburg, TX :D
