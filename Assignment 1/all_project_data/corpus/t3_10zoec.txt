Well, you probably have read similar posts already. Still I have to try.

So situation is this:
I had sort of a big fight with my parents who up until a two month ago helped me financially out while I am studying for my bachelor degree.
Well coming this month the fees were due and while I sort of managed to pay them I now have a three digits debt on my account.
And this is the start of the month. 
I have good chances (okok... let's say medium chances) on getting a part time job beginning of November but this doesn't really help for now. 

I am though a hobbyist digital artist. This is my deviantart profile:

While I can't promise anything, I might be able to make a picture for you. Providing you want me to.

Anyway? Anyone out there who feels very generous?
