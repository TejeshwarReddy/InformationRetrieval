My partner and main support system is out of the country for three months. Work has been especially frustrating and I'm waiting to hear if I got into the school I want to go to. Rent and bills have emptied my accounts and while I do have food at home, (rice and beans) I'm just feeling too overwhelmed to cook. 

I'm located in Portland, OR.
