Umm, pizza god? Hi, its me, chemo. My little brother and I have no money for food, and our fridge is completely empty save for some frozen corn. Were trying to save that for the weekend. I will try to do any stunt you can think of for pizza. Jump off my roof? I'll do it. Ask a stranger for a ride around the block? I'll do it. Smoke peppercorns? You bet your sweet bippy. I will post a video of the stunt, and post it here. We live in north Texas, in the dfw area. Thanks for listening!
