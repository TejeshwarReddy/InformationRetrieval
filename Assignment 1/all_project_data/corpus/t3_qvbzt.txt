Hello there, RAOP.
Pittsburgh PA here.
As the title states, I have been out of work and been living off my food stamps.

I am not doing horrible, I promise you that, but I have the biggest hankering for a pizza.

I assure you, once my bills are in order again, I will pay it forward.

Thank you for your time, and consideration.
