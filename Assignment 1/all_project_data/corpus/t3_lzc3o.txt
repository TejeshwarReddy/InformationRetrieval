My boyfriend and I are in a bad spot right now, and it's been a really long, hungry week. The majority of our situation is detailed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/lvgsj/request_please_help_us_keep_a_roof_over_our_heads/). Basically, we're both out of work right now, and life just kinda sucks. We've both had to drop out for the semester, missed too many classes due to not having enough gas. We're looking for full-time work, but so far the 6 temp agencies we both signed up for haven't called. 

One redditor was willing to donate a very generous $150, but it won't be transfered to my bank via Paypal until Friday or Monday. Our pets have food for the moment, but their humans are very hungry! Our cabinets/fridge are basically bare, other than spices and seasoning. We used up the last of our leftovers yesterday, and now we're down to bread, peanut butter, and water. And we've had a LOT of peanut butter, bread, and water lately. I hate to ask, but we literally don't even have a dollar until that money shows up.

If anyone wanted to send us a pizza or two, that'd be amazing. Signed up for a verification code just in case ;). We'd be more than willing to send you pizza(s) back when our transfer goes through, pay it forward to some other person here in need, or provide any variety of services as part of the agreement. Also, FWIW, we're in Bonner Springs, Kansas. Have Pizza Hut within delivery distance, and Dominos/Papa Johns within pick-up distance.

Please?
