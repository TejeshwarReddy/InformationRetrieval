It used to be that my brother and I would hang out together every Sunday, though since my niece was born, we haven't had that ability as frequently.  He is going to be here around 12pm PST (it is 9:15am currently) and I would like to have something for us to eat while he's here, though I am flat broke.  I even offer up the obligatory picture of [me with my niece](http://i.imgur.com/kvM0ISL.png) (taken just hours after she was born).  A pizza would very much be appreciated.

*EDIT - It turns out that it was a false alarm.  My brother was unable to make it here today after all, so I can have some soup.  Thanks anyway, RAOP.  I may try again one of these days.
