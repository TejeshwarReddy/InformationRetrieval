Before I begin I would like to apologize for this being a new account. I have been lurking reddit for years and after finding this subreddit I had to make an account. I am a single mother who is not starving but after the father of my children left us we have been living off rice, beans, and oatmeal. It would really help lift our spirits if we could have a special meal tonight for a change. PM me if you want any details. Thanks!

Edit:MisterGrizzly sent me a dominos gift card. Thank you so much for the generosity!
