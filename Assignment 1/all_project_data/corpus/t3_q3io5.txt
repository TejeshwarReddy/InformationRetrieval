Admittedly, I was doing pretty well.  I was not having any financial problems and I was able to save some money.  Then my job cut my pay rate.  Suddenly I was struggling to pay the bills, but I managed. 

Last week my wife went from being able to breast feed our son to completely dried up.  Now we have the added expense of lactose intolerant formula (he can't drink milk based stuff; it makes him sick) and a reduced income.  Faced with the decision of eating or feeding our son, we opted for the formula.

Unfortunately, I will not receive my paycheck until Saturday. We have enough formula for our son, but we've literally run out of food for ourselves.  Two days without food is not a lot -- and we could manage without -- but I would love to greet my wife with pizza tomorrow.
