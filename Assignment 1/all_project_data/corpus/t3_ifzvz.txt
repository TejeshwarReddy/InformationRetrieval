Hi, I am requesting some help. I will not starve or anything, but I am getting by on cereal and enough bread for maybe two more sandwiches until unemployment comes through (hopefully) early in the week. I will pay it forward as soon as I get my unemployment. 
Thank you so much. Even if you do not choose me thank you just for caring.
