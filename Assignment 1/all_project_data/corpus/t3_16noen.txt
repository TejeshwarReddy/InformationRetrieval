Anyone want to send us a domino's pizza? I can't spend what little money I have until the 4th of February and my boyfriend only has about $5. We only have 4 slices of bologna and a block of cheese~ looking for something a bit more exciting than bologna and cheese :/
Willing to send a present in exchange &lt;3
