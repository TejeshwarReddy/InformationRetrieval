First and foremost this is a throwaway, with that being said I am willing to provide more verification then most people asking. (Pictures of me and the pizza, a phone number, etc)

I just moved back to this city, I have my mother coming to bring me food on tuesday and I did not eat yesterday. I do have a job and a place to live but that is really the extent of it, just looking for food. Yesterday I used my last few dollars to get a pizza special and some noodles, I really would prefer to not eat these noodles now.

I prey someone out there has a kind heart,
