I took an online calculus class (big mistake) followed by an online calculus 2 class (even huger mistake).  I'm taking the calc 2 final tonight and after getting A's on all of my assignments and studying for days, it's looking like it won't go good.  Pizza would really hit the spot. 

ALSO - If someone does end up buying the pizza, you can watch me eat it on skype.
