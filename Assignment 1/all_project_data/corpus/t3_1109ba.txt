Hello guys I am an arizona student attending college for the first time, I recently ran out of my food stamp support for the month for sharing with my unemployed friends/roommates while they get a job and won't have them again until next friday : ( 

I was wondering if anyone can make me a huge favor with a simple pizza to eat this evening?

Thank you very much for reading.
