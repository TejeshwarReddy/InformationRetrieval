Hey, RAOP. I'm a college student in Seattle, Washington. I just scored a job and am expecting my first paycheck in a little over a week, but as of right now I'm down to a a couple cans of green beans and 3 potatoes, and I need a bit more to tide me over until I can get money for groceries. A friend recommended I try to drop a post here and see how it goes, so here I am.
