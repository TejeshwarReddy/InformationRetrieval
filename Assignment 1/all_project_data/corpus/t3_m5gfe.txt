So my bank card mysteriously stopped working.  And  so I cant withdraw cash.  I sent a message to the bank but they wont get back to me for 24 hours.  Basically I havent eaten today.  I have to get off the hostel computer so I cant stick around so please post in the comments if you decide to help me out so other users know.  IÂ´m staying at Hostal Forestal, Coronel Santiago Bueras 122, Santiago de Chile and my name is Nick.  This subreddit is amazing by the way!
