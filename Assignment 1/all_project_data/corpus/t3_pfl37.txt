I am a Nova Scotia Canadian Resident league hockey player. This is just for fun, but this year our team has had a very disappointing season. With not a single win...This is no Beggar for pizza, but A challenge We play a are 4th last game tonight at 11:30pm Atlantic time.(10:30 Eastern). If we win our first game tomorrow night someone buys us Dominoes pizza. We have a fairly small team of only about 12 guys. So anybody feeling an underdog victory? The scores will be posted online hopefully not to long after them game.

TL;DR - My hockey team has gone they entire season with no in thus far. We play tonight if we win someone grateful soul gives us a Dominoes gift card...I'm willing to do verification, and I can prove the score when the game is posted on my university website.
