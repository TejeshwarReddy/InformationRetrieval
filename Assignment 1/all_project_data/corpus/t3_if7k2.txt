We are a family of 3 who would enjoy a pizza tonite.We live in Houston were its 100 degres today!We have a sm. apt. with one A.C. unit. We keep the kitchin and bedroom blocked off to keep at least one room cool.I do have afew packs of meat but it just so unbarable to cook. My son always asks why iam dripping with sweat.It would be great to enjoy a meal togeather without me having to go take a shower frist and eating by myself.I just saw PAY IT BACK afew weeks ago and just loved the concept! CANT WAIT TILL I CAN PAY IT BACK! Thanks to all that support this ideia!!!
