I wasn't sure if this was considered a contest or a request, but since I'm the one asking for a pizza I went with the latter.

Anywho, I'd like to have a little fun around here, and since I'm bored and hungry I'd figure why not? I am willing to do just about anything (within reason) for pizza. 

**Things I won't do**: Anything illegal, Porn, anything dangerous to myself or others (including eating gross stuff).

**Things I will do**: Draw you a picture, sing whatever you want and post it on soundcloud, make up a funny/scary story, etc.

Use your imagination, and let's have fun with this! Just make sure if you ask me to do something you're actually able to pay up the pie. Since I have nothing to do today I might open it up to everyone once I get a pizza offer. 


**EDIT**: This is still ongoing. I received one request but they never got back with me, so I'm still willing to continue this as long as there's interest out there.
