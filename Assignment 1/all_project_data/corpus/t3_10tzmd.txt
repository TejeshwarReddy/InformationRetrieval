I'm a twenty year old who is taking time off from school, and just recently started working at a drugstore. I'm still a week away from getting my first paycheck, after being unemployed for two months, and I have $1.77 to my name after paying for rent. I would be greatly appreciative of even a small pizza, because I haven't eaten since Sunday. I'm sure this is a longshot because not many people are willing to spend that money, and I understand that completely. If out of some miracle the pizza angels are smiling upon me today I will gladly repay the favor as soon as I get my paycheck. I suppose it's also a significant fact that I'm vegetarian.
