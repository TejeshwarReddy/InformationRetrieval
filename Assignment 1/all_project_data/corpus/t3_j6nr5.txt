I saw a link to this subreddit on the front page, WTF; is my reaction after reading what its about..  
I couldn't believe it.

I haven't entirely looked through other requests as I'm pretty sure I'm not the only hungry person in the world, but tbh after I read the sidebar I immediately grabbed my camera and made a "REQUEST" because I'm hungry.

The embarrassing part is asking for food on the internet- forget that,

[1] Food going bad, fridge practically empty  
[2] Ice-cream I bought gone bad, this is after I knew my refrigerator started trolling  
[3] I'm not starving I have lots of bread, but as you can see I can't stand it, at least for today.  

I give my praise to anyone that fulfills my request.   
When I get the money I'm seriously giving back a redditor a free pizza.

**update:** being able to get free pizza from a fellow redditor I don't even know is unreal  
I feel terribly bad, I just found out about this sub-reddit and within 3 hours a redditor gives me a pizza  
I feel as if I'm cutting in line, however I'm grateful and I thank you.   
Don't forget someone will get a pizza from me.

**update 2:** I've done myself a good [deed](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/jcpic/offer_10_dominos_gift_card_me_giving_back/), but I can tell you this isn't the end.
