Hi there. My fiance and I are down on our luck in Las Vegas (and no, not from gambling, lol). I was the only breadwinner, and I got laid off last week. My unemployment money hasn't kicked in yet, and things are getting quite tight. Our fridge is down to that one jar of relish that everybody seems to have, some Taco Bell hot sauce packets, and some jelly, so I was hoping someone would be kind enough to help us out with a hot meal. 

If there is a generous soul out there who sends us a pizza, I will certainly pay it forward once things turn around for us. Thanks so much for reading, I really appreciate it!
