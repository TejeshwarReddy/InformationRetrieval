I just graduated and realized I have no job and and $35000 in student loans. I haven't even been able to celebrate my graduation much at all because I don't have money.

A free pizza would really make me feel better about my situation in general, at least for a little while.

I know there are a lot of people in more need than me and I want to leave this subreddit better off than I found it. So, I definitely plan on buying pizza for random redditors in need once I have a job.

Forgot to mention: It's my last 48 hours in NYC before I move upstate.

**Edit:** 

The good news: A very kind person who wished to remain anonymous sent me a $20 e-gift card to Pizza Hut!

The bad news: Even though I live in New York freakin' City, there is no pizza hut close enough that delivers to me! And I don't have a car. So, as of right now, I am unable to use it.

The second good news: I am moving soon. So, I will either use this in the near future or I will just pass it on to some other individual in need!

So, thank you RAOP! I am pretty happy right now, even though I am not eating pizza at the moment!
