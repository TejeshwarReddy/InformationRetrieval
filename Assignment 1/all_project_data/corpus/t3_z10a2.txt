Totally in need of some food! Pizza sounds great. My boyfriend and I are currently getting evicted. No money. Soon we will be going to the shelter, but we have to wait until our eviction is final to get any kind of assistance. 
(Edit) I live in Jackson, Michigan! Sorry :( New to all this. My friend told me about this.
