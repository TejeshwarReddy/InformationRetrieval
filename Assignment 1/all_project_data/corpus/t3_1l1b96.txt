I'm going to be completely honest here about my stupidity. I went to the store today and spent my last bit of money buying some alcohol and didnt even think about the fact that I have no food. Now I am at home, and have no money and no food in my house.

A friend of mine told me about you guys, so I thought I would give it a try. Thank you in advanced for even reading this.

Cheers
