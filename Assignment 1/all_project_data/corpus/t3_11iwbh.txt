Unexpected costs regarding my car have made it very difficult to keep up. If I can avoid borrowing money from anyone until Friday, I should be on track. That being said, I am tired of eating firm tofu or celery and vegan peanut butter. I have gas in the car to get to work, I just need a few nights worth of food (real food) to get through til payday. Once I am back on track, I promise to pay it forward here. 
**EDIT: Forgot to mention I am in the Las Vegas area. If there is something you want from here/me let me know I am definitely willing to work something out.**
