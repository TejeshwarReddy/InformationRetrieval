I have not had much to eat in the last couple of days because my stores have run out. I spent the last of my money on dog food before I get paid in a few days because Marley needs to eat more than I do. I would appreciate a pizza so much, I usually conserve my money better than this but I really failed this month. I swear to repay the favor when I'm in better financial standing. Thank you very much.
