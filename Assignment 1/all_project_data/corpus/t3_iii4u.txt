hey raop...i already rec'd the hookup earlier last week before moving.  i was hoping that someone out there could hook up another pizza tonight.  we moved all weekend, and are tapped out until snap benefits hit on the 9th.  after i a job i'll be glad to pay it back or pay it forward.  i need to feed myself, my girlfriend, and of course the two cats love scraps of ham off the pizza.

edit: oh yeah i forgot, western ky here!  help a hillbilly out, ya'll!

UPDATE: om nom!  thanks to sbrinkley1104 me and mine are eating hot fresh pizza tonight!  thanks ya'll
