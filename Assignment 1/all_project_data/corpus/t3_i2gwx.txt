Hey friends- I just moved to a new town to attend graduate school in the fall. I was told by my employer, Walmart, that transferring to a store down here would be no problem at all. As it turns out- the Walmart down here can't find a spot for me for at least a few more weeks. I will get my last paycheck in the mail (from the last Walmart I worked at) late next week, but my funds have dwindled from the move and I haven't been able to afford much more than a box of ramen to keep me full. I just learned that a church across the street from me runs a food pantry, but they're only open on Wednesdays. If a redditor would be kind enough to help me fill my belly this evening, I will gladly return the favor when funds return. Many thanks, Sarah
