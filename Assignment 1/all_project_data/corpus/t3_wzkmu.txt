My boss was supposed to pay me on Friday, asked if I could wait until Saturday. Haven't seen him all weekend, and this has seriously demonified my situation. Could use a 'za for the night. Will pay it forward next week!

Despite the remote location, we have Domino's, Pizza Hut and Boston Pizza. Order take out - I'm nearby all of them and I can save you delivery.

Thanks!
