First time posting here.  My husband and I work a very tough schedule so that we can keep our kids out of daycare (cant afford it anyhow.).  We do not even own a car, so we often get about 30 minutes TOPS to see each other between shifts.  It'd be nice to fill th e void with a pizza.  I do have an account with PapaJohns, and they are the closest to me.  Here we have a "local deal" (Cowboys Special) where for $14 and change (with delivery charge) I can get a large pizza and a 2 liter for us.
