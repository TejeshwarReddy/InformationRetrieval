I have been in pain this whole week. I couldn't eat anything but like yogurt. I havn't gotten good sleep because my painkillers only last for 6 hours at a time. But today, I am finally able to eat substantial foods and i have been craving a pizza for a very long time. but sadly, i'm broke :[ 

I just discovered this subreddit and am going out on a limb. I feel bad since i see a lot of people that might be in a worse situation than me, but all i know, is that i will come back to RAOP because this place is awesome. I will return the favor. i hope my request is met cuz im dying of pain and craving over here. 

THANKS in advanced
