My birthdays coming up here and well, I've got absolutely nothing going on. Everyone parties on my day while I stay at home and watch the ball drop. I know how odd it is to ask for a present but hey let's try it, a present of pizza!

Here's some [proof](http://imgur.com/VnXUH) that New Years is indeed my birthday. Really haven't a way to show my sad party... Just picture a person, in front of a computer and my cat wearing a birthday hat!

Edit: got pizza'd and had a fun time... even Que had  a bite :) Thanks morzinbo!
