Hello RAOP!  As the title says our company's contract was terminated on Monday leaving me without work.  I did not eat all day yesterday as I've been too busy.  I have never tried this before but I have a craving for some pizza and thought I would give it a shot.   Looking forward to paying it forward once I land another job.  That's part of the fun.  
Well, anyway, thanks for listening to my story.
