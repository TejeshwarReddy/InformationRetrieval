Wow this is so amazing! Maybe reddit can help me out? I've been unemployed for three weeks. I applied for unemployment when I was dismissed from my last job at a restaurant. I had been working there for six months since it opened and it changed everything for me. I was on the verge of getting evicted when they hired me and I was able to turn that whole situation around because they took a chance on me. Now I'm more confident that even though I had been fired I immediately went out there to find more work. And even though I haven't been able to find more than a few temporary assignments I'm not discouraged about it.

However I am not living so comfortably. I had been living very much month to month. And I was able to pay June rent I don't have much left for food. Since I had been working at a restaurant I just ate for free there. Now I applied for food stamps in California but am not able to get an interview for benefits until after the 4th of July weekend. I showed up to the office and waited all day only to tell me that I can't do anything until that interview.

I've been paying for my food with change I find around the house. My unemployment check won't come until they do a phone interview on Friday with me. I won't have any money after I pay July's rent. And I definitely won't be able to pay utilities without the unemployment check. I don't want to seem like begging but I would pay it forward if you could help a fella out reddit.
