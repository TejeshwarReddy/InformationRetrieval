after couch surfing for months, going through job loss and rejections, bank trouble, college loans, unreliable friends, my girlfriend and I finally got enough money to pay for a lease on an apartment. I just spent the last 2 days both studying for the biggest final of my life and lugging furniture up three flights of stairs until two in the morning. I just took my exam and i nailed it thank god, however i don't have any money for lunch for the next week. i was hoping that someone would be kind enough to get one for me..this has been a 6 month struggle that has finally come together.
