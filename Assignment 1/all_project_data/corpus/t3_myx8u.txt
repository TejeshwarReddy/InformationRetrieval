I've been having a hard time recently and I'm unemployed but I'm not eligible for any welfare because I'm not British. I'm hardly managing to pay my rent and gas bills and it's freezing up her right now. Some pizza would go a long way tonight. I don't believe in karma, but I will pay it forward. 

I'll answer any questions here. 

Thanks.
