In the middle of my final year university exams, got one left next Tuesday... I have no money to eat tonight and just have a pack of supernoodles, you'd be making my week! A pizza would make life seem slightly more bearable and get me to the weekend. 

I'd be eternally grateful and you can live with the knowledge you helped a man get his degree. :)
