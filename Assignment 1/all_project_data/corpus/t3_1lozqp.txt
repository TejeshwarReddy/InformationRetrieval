Hey Reddit. I feel horrible for this, but here I am, asking for pizza. I've just moved from Alabama to Austin, Texas, in an attempt to change my life's direction and take charge of my student debt etc. To that end, I've gotten a job in Austin and am currently living on the floor in my own apartment (can't afford a bed). My check is coming on Friday, for three weeks' work at a big box retailer, but I haven't been able to afford food for four days, all my my remaining income going towards gas to get to/from work. Anyway, I would very much appreciate some kind of assistance, though I know you are in no way obligated to do so. 

It'd totally make my week though. &lt;3
