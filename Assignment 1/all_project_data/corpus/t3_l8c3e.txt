Last week and a half hasn't been to good, car got totaled on Thursday n found out that the driver has no insurance, found out one of my family members has been commiting identity fraud past 5 years. N yesterday lost my wallet and food stamp card. Asking for a little help until Friday, will definitely be appreciated n once things settle down I will definitley give back.
