Give me your mission and if my response pleases you, feel free to send me a pizza. 

Or just make me do something for free if you decide to not send me a pizza, that's fine. Go on a power trip to see how far I will go for a potential pizza? That's fine. I am not "in need" but I will do some random things for random pizza.
