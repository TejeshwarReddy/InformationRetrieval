Title says it all. Today has been absolutely horrible. I was taking my youngest to a doctors appointment and my starter went out, my car is now sitting in the doctor's office parking lot until I am able to get to Cash Advance to take a loan out to get the parts my brother will fix it but being this late I have no way to get to the store with my FSC, I'm really exhausted. My cabinets and refrigerator is completely empty, I can send pictures as proof as well as any other proof. I really just want my children to eat.
