my children are coming home after being gone 21 days and i would like to take them for pizza when they get here but i can not afford it.  we are a family that  lives paycheck to paycheck and are often short on funds, with school starting next week we are truly in the hole.  I want to be able to sit down with my girls and talk about their trip without having to worry about anything.  Thank you.
