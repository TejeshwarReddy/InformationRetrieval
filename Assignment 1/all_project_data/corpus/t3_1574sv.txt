just kidding, obviously not on the ISS.  But having been unemployed for a bit and using any extra money for bills I am a bit tired of ramen and rice.  It'd just be nice to have some pizza. But at the same time if there is another person who is having a tough time and needing pizza, give it to them.  Because I'll be alright, I have ramen :)
