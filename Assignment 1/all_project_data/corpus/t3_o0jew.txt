The Wednesday before Christmas I was fired from my job.  I previously worked for major corporations and moved to an independent computer repair company because I thought it would be a better opportunity.  After my first two weeks I noticed that some less than ethical and legal things were happening.  I saw the companies 40 + year old head tech go through a teenage girls picture file because he thought she was attractive and also the company wasn't following labor laws.  I raised a concerns because I could have been held liable for some of the issues that were happening.  A few days later I was fired, the reason was "You don't fit in with our company".  I'm looking for another job and until then repairing computers for friends, but a random act of pizza would defiantly help restore my faith in humanity.  I know my account is new, but I can easily give you proof that I am legit.  I suppose in the long run I may not have a job, but I do have my ethics.
