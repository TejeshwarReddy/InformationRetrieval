Me and my boy (5 years of age) wouldn't mind eating something other than noodles today.

[Take a look at our fridge..](http://imgur.com/LGM7N)

Luckily before my unemployment ran out I got the bright idea to stock up on [noodles](http://imgur.com/5N5rA), and [such](http://imgur.com/Fn1ee).(There are 28 square packs left and 36 cups for those who are curious..)

I am in no way implying that we are without food to eat (coz' noodles count as food right?), just wondering if anyone out there wouldn't mind tossing a pie our way.


**Edit**: I am no longer in need of pizza for tonight, fate has smiled upon me and my son, providing us with pizza from another source. Thank you anyway reddit :)
