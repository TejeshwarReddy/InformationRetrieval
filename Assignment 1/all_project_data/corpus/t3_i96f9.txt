Sorry for the new account, but I never had a reason to make an account before this.

I have been surfing Reddit for quite a while.

I get paid every other Friday and won't get another paycheck until July 1st.

I don't have any money or food in the house and all the local places that help with food are closed until Monday. 

A pizza would really lift my spirits.

If anyone is willing to help me I would sincerely appreciate it.

Thank you!

Edit: hogfathom got me a pizza thank u so much
