Ohhh that tense wait for blood test results, at first 6 months apart.  Brutal.  Even after being declared Cancer free, the nagging worry of a return just festers inside of you.  I finally made it to only having one test a year, and no more nightmarish CAT scans. Today was my first yearly result call. 

You expect anything but good new, because you prep yourself for worst thing he could possibly say.  You brace yourself in defense of it, for weeks after they draw the blood from your veins.  It builds and builds up until that call.  And then it comes.  That intolerable small talk when the Doctor first gets on the line.  It's a pleasant exchange, though the entire time, you're mind is screaming "SAY IT, SAY IT DAMN YOU, WHAT DID THE BLOOD LOOK LIKE!?  YOU SAVED MY LIFE BUT I WILL LOSE IT IF WE TALK ABOUT MY COLLEGE OR THE WEATHER FOR ANOTHER MOMENT!".    

"No changes, which is a good thing".

Deafening relief.

The world just somehow looks better after this call, it smells better, everything is vivid, clearer, more alive.  Please help me with a celebration meal worthy of this feeling.  My favorite pizza, I do not have the funds for it.  I can think of nothing else right now that I would enoy more than a simple Large Bacon Pineapple Pizza from Dominoes with BBQ sauce instead of marinara.  If it was a wild animal I would hunt it with my instincts and wits alone.  But alas.  If you see fit I thank you for any help you may give.
