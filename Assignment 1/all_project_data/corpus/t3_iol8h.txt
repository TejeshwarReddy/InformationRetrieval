June 29th I was fired from my job for "not being a good fit for the company." (Almost verbatim what I was told. This was after working there nearly a year, and being moved halfway across the country to another office for them, but I digress.)


My unemployment interview isn't until today (within the next two hours) and I can't send in my first form until the 17th. (Willing to provide a picture of the form I got with that info on it as necessary.)


My mother gets paid friday and said she'll be able to help out then (she's back in California, where I was moved from) but until them I'm hungry and all out of food. I've already tapped all my friends and they've been more than generous, so I don't think I can really turn to them.

I did the verification thing on the right, so PM me if you want the code or want me to post it or whatever. **I will pay this forward as soon as I have a job again. Mark my words.** 

Please and thanks, all the best.
