I am just now finding this subreddit and boy did it come at the perfect time. At the beginning of the month, my father passed away, leaving my husband and I to beg off family to pay for the plane ticket to Texas. Worth it to say goodbye to my daddy, but still horrible. When we got back my husband discovered he was not being hired as a teacher at the school he worked at for the following year because he wasn't catholic enough (yes, it was a Catholic school board). This after two years of working for this board, being an active member of the school community, and being loved by all of the students and their parents. He was devastated.
Right now he is sitting at the kitchen table filling out application after application... We have $20 inour bank account and his last paycheck, coming in two weeks has to be spent for our big move to Toronto in a month. I am unemployed (I'm immigrating to Canada and they haven't issued a work visa yet) and just want to see my husband have something super neat and nice happen. Earlier he came into the room and said he wished we could order a pizza... Half an hour later I found this! 
I'm willing to provide any proof you ask for and as soon as we are on our feet again I wOuld love to return the favor! Is there anyone willing to give a random act of pizza to a couple looking to smile at least once this month?!

UPDATE:
Dinner box arrived! Here are some pictures of my husband and I with our amazing treat from Belgar! My husband was so freakin' surprised! It was awesome! So thank you for totally making out evening!! Also, sorry if I'm doing this wrong!!
