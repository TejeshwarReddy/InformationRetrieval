I was doing the keto diet for about a month and a half and lost about 20 lbs. I fell of the wagon about two weeks ago and while I haven't put any weight back on, I've stalled the weight loss. 

I'm starting again tomorrow and I'm craving pizza like crazy but it's not in the budget. 
If anyone is curious about the keto diet check out /r/keto its awesome!

Oh and I'm in MN USA

Thanks!
