So my husband and i are so far into the red in our bank account its ridiculous from helping our friends who decided to visit and their card stopped working. Now its Monday after noon and I'm working on my novel craving a pizza. Anyone feel like helping? We'll pay it forward and confirm what ever you want from us.
