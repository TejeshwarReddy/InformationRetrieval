Hello I just read this article:

http://abcnews.go.com/US/random-acts-pizza-donate/story?id=13950694

And it is amazing that something like this actually exists over the internet, I am here for assistance , because sad to say I am hungry and have been for the past 2 days and my check for the week has already been spent on paying the rent and fixing my car brakes.

If anyone with a kind heart can help me, I promise to return next week and give pizzas to those in need thank you
