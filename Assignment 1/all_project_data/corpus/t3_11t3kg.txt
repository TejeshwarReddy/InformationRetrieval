Hi,

I live in Glasgow, UK and I have no money to buy food until Monday. I am hungry. Could a kind Redditor please order me a pizza today from http://www.dominos.co.uk 

The pizza costs £11.49. I have about £3.25 in my paypal account I can send you. 

The pizza I would die to eat right now is:

Meatilicious
Pepperoni, ham, chicken breast strips, smoked bacon rashers, cumberland sausage

Looks like this: http://imgur.com/fFxxt

Small (6 slices), £11.49

Can anyone help?
