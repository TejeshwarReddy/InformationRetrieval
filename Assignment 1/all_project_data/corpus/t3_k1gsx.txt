Hi RAOP! This will be my first time requesting your service. I'm currently a senior up here at the University of Idaho, located in the unbelievably small town, Moscow, where the plains are rolling and the smell of cow ass is abundant.

Anyway, this is my second semester of living in an apartment and I'm still working on getting a budget together. Normally I do a fairly good job, but this semesters worth of books cost about double what I had originally planned for. Normally this wouldn't be too much of a problem, but in a town this small it's very hard to find a job. So I was hoping that a nice meal would be just the break I needed before I get back to struggling through the rest of the semester.

Thanks for listening and have a wonderful day. &lt;3
