Came home to a broken fridge filled with curdling milk and molded cheese. The repairman came and said it would cost less to just buy a new fridge than to get the parts to fix it. I live in Missouri and don't really want to give my location, so giftcard...? Never posted here before! Also there is Imo's where I live.
