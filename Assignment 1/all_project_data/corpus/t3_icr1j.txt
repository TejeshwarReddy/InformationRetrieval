I feel bad for asking, but this is probably the hardest point of my life so far. I just graduated high school, and i got kicked out right away. I've been living with my boyfriend but hes just as broke as i am. If anyone could help me out right now, i'd be highly grateful and will return the offer when possible. :)

btw, sorry for the sketchy account. I'm a lurker (never really felt the need to comment on stuff. =/)
