I'm having a hard time building up strength to even post this. I feel so weak, I haven't ate in 3 days, haven't slept, haven't worked.. I'm just so gone.

4AM Thursday morning I hear a big thump and then I hear the lady down stairs screaming in the hallway... Her husband fell in the shower I'm not sure if he had a stroke or what exactly happen, as she dialed 911 I held him in my arms and he stopped breathing. I tried to do everything I could to bring him back. I'm in shock and so sad, it's just unreal. I feel bad for the man and the lady.. I'm so depressed over the situation. 

I live out in the country a bit, and I'm just too depressed to go anywhere or do anything.. I plan on trying to go see a therapist tomorrow (if ones open) and head back to work Monday. 

I think it would be great if someone could order me a pizza and me snuggle up with my journal tonight and possibly watch a movie to help ease my mind.....I really don't feel comfortable driving, I just need to relax and do some coping skills.
