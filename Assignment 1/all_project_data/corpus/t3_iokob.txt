I'm new to this community, turned on by a friend the other day, and I figured I'd give it a shot and see what happens. I was about to post my request, but I feared it would get mixed in with everyone else's and get lost.

My son and I have fallen on some hard times recently. His father passed away about a month ago from a massive heart attack (they call it a widow-maker heart attack, go figure), and we've just been slammed with a bunch of expenses. Jason, my son, is taking it really hard. He's about to turn 15, and his father was his idol.

I would love to surprise him with a pizza some night, maybe get his mind off the whole situation, but I just can't swing it financially at this point, and was wondering if you were still helping out those within the community.

If not, I completely understand, you've provided a huge service to this community already, but I'll keep my fingers crossed.

Thank you so very much
