So after 3 weeks of living off of ramen like some walking stereotype, I am in desperate need of solid food. My buddies were supposed to celebrate the end of the semester with me tonight but instead have abandoned me for their "girlfriends."(Pfft) I'm just stuck here on a Thursday with my penis and a laptop. Please help me get a little pizza love to keep me warm tonight.
