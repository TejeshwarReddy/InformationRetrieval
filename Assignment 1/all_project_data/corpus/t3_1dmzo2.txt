Hello, RAoP. Long time lurker, occasional commenter, first time poster.

In any case finals are looming in on me and, while I certainly have a chance to kick their ass and earn myself a 3.0 GPA this semester, I am still nervous. It is for this reason why I am requesting a pizza-- to have a little motivation and something delicious to eat while studying.

I will have money come in at the end of the month, so when that time comes I should be able to pay it forward. Thanks so much for your consideration. :)

edit: I made a typo I hadn't realized until now.... I corrected it though! :3

EDIT2: KYLE-BROFLOSKI has went above and beyond for me and ordered a lot more than I had requested! Thank you so much!!
