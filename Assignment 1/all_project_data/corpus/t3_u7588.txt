My father is a Long haul truck driver and just lost his job, and he is stuck in Maryland. Im here in california with no food, just ran out of flour that I was making "buiscuts" ie. Water + flour. help me out please, and I will help someone else when the cash comes in. Just turned 18, and yes, I've been looking for a JOB! Ive been lurking reddit for a very long time. I feel kind of bad that this is the reason I finally joined.
