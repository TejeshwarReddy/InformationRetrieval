Here is my story. My mother is finally done with getting treated for breast cancer but with all the treatments we have had to cut back on a few things. We never go out to eat and we try to limit our food usage because we need to save our money for getting two cars fixed and get a new/used car that my parents can use for work. My dad has his own business but he only does small things so not much money comes in that way. My mom gets up at 5 in the morning sometimes earlier so she can get extra hours to get more money and being in a small town I have gotten a job as a babysitter but need to keep missing days because I have teeth problems. I have to go back to school next year to finish the classes I missed from being in a very abusive relationship so more money will be put towards that. It would be nice if one day I came home with supper in hand for us and eat as a family. If anyone needs proof or knows more information then contact me I live in Ogema, WI and i am 18.

I have gotten help!
