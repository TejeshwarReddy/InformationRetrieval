Hey guys,

I posted [this](http://redd.it/i4s6l) over at r/Assistance a couple of days ago, and things are still pretty grim. I haven't had a warm, substantial meal in about a week or so, and I have absolutely no funds to speak of. A delicious pizza would go a long way towards brightening my day, and I'd be more than happy to pay it forward when I get on my feet again. I don't have any sort of preference, but I think both Pizza Hut and Domino's deliver to my house. Thanks for reading guys, and I want to say that this subreddit consistently amazes me. Y'all are awesome.
