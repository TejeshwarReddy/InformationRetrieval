Hey all, student in southern California here, and I'm pretty short on cash for now. I've been limiting myself to a meal of macaroni/ramen a day to save some money. A 'za would be pretty bomb-diggity right now, as would be the kind person who might lend me a hand in this scenario. Much gratitude to anyone who considers -- I'm hoping one day I'll be the one in a position to give out pizzas here. Thanks for reading.
