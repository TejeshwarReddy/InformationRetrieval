Welcome our 1st (and hopefully only *fingers crossed*) baby to Earth a week &amp; a half ago. Needless to say running on 1-3 hours of sleep a day and paying off doctor &amp; hospital has left us with very little money after essential bills have been paid. We're gaining a room mate next month which will free up money to reciprocate a pizza to a Redditor. Until then any thing helps!
