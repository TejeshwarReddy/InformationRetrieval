Tampa Bay Florida area, my roomie and I just hit up the mall and got gifts for our families. We tried to go to McDonalds on the way home and be Dollar Menunaires but my card was declined! Seems that even though we're working insane hours (retail slaves) for the holidays,  we underestimated our money &amp; now we're broke as a joke till payday with no food in the fridge. I've never posted here before but now seems like a great time to rely on the kindness of strangers. :]
