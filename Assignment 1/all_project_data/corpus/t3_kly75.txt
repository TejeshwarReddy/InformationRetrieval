I'm sure I can talk the hospital into making me only pay a fraction of the cost, but it's a bit of a downer as it still will wind up being at least a 1/10th of what I make a year.

Anyway, if someone is up for tossing me a bit of a pick me u I'm in Elkhart, IN and I'd be very appreciative. Otherwise, I have cans of soup and some saltines.

(Not sure if I have to post proof or something. I'll see if I can get my scanner to work in the mean time)
