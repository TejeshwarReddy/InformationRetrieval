Hey all you wonderful redditors! I'm a 21m here and my girlfriend of almost 3 years broke up with me last night.  I'm too poor to go out anywhere (55 cents in my account) and was wondering if someone could make my day (and stomach) a bit happier with some food? I'll be sure to pay back the favor when I'm in a better situation!
