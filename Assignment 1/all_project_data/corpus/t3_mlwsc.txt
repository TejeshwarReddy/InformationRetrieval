Finally, Today after about 6 months, our foster children are here! We are so excited. We now have 4 children ( 3 foster and 1 Biological) After spending time with them, clothes shopping and etc, We are totally beat. Get this THEY HAVE NEVER had pizza! We'd like to treat the whole family for pizza, but from shopping , we're all monied out! Until our next paycheck. If anyone wants to share this moment with us, it would be awesome and we will TOTALLY return the favor as SOON as we can.! I see that people offer pictures. We will send some of our FOUR children ( it makes me so happy to say that) Enjoying that yummy pizza. We are located in Midwest City, Ok and have a papa johns right down the street.! Pepperoni is always a favorite. We have 4 kids, plus me and my husband! Like I said we will return the favor, we are just so happy for our blessings and shocked they have never had an american favorite :)
