We're in Washington state. We spent the rest of our money catching up on bills this month. My cousin worked extra hard at his job to make sure we could cover the bills. I'd love to surprise him with a nice hot pizza when he gets home a little after 9. I'm willing to make a deal to hold a contest 8/23/2013 for a pizza giveaway.

Edit: I am willing to set this up for a different day. He still deserves a pizza even if it's not tonight.
