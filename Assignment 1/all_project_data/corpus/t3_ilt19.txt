My partner and I are currently both out of work, sleeping on a mates floor, and for the past few months have never had more than 50 pounds to our name each week. 

I was  severely unwell on a day I had an appointment at the job centre last week,  and would have been paid our meagre amount to live on  yesterday, but due to my illness we will not have any money for at least four more days until the job centre process their paperwork. 

We have 1 pound in coppers, and half a bag of rice to survive on, but could really do with a wholesome meal to keep us going for the next few days, especially as I have a job interview tomorrow for which I do not want to be a weak mess.  Any kind of offer will be greatly appreciated and thanks for reading.
