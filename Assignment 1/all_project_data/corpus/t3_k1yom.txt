My AMA was titled [IAMA wildly incompetent network security admin and have no business in my job. AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cuc07/iama_wildly_incompetent_network_security_admin/)

If you goto [/r/IAMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/top/?sort=top&amp;count=75&amp;t=all&amp;after=t3_akrna) (link is already sorted) select "All time" and sort by "Top" you'll see it's ranked exactly #100.

The job was a nice run, but honestly I enjoyed writing the AMA more than I enjoyed my job.  It was soul crushing be so worthless and being paid for it. I know that sounds hard to believe, but I assure you, it's the truth.

At any rate, I'm depressed, but I'm excited to finally be free.  I will be going back into computers most likely, but something that I'm actually good at. Troubleshooting, help desk, etc.  Certainly not network security.  

FWIW, i was actually laid off by the executives, not fired for incompetence.

My wife is out of town and she doesn't even know yet.  It's just me and my 3 kids hanging out tonight.  Anyone feel like sending a few medium pizzas our way?  The thank you pictures will be marvelous indeed.  Of course I can't show our faces, since the IAMA is rather incriminating... :)  I'm not proud, but I'm not ashamed! 

edit:  It'll be [hot dogs and blueberry bagels](http://i.imgur.com/k2SlM.jpg) if nobody wants to help this worthless secadmin in another 30 min or so.  After that, I'll just delete this post. Last thing I need is to have more eyes gandering at that AMA when I start job hunting! :)
2nd edit:  well I'll call it for tonight.  I sincerely appreciate anyone that read this and considered Randoming a pizza to me, even if you decided against it.  Just the thought is worth it in my book.  We ate some dogs and bagels so we're g2g for tonight.  Thanks so much to everyone.


**EDIT:  I withdraw my request for a pizza.  There's others that deserve it more.  The fact that I was paid for a job that I was horrible at does make me feel like I shouldn't be asking for a pizza.  My family and I will be fine.  i appreciate all the offers.  **

**I ask that if you really were going to get me a pizza today, you instead get one for "halohoppe".  He obviously has such low opinions of majority of humanity that I think everyone would be better off if his faith was restored slightly.
I'll admit I was upset when he posted twice about what a scumbag I am, and how I just like free shit, but he's right.  I do like free shit, and I was paid to be in a job that i was not fit for.  i had other duties and continued to work, and had a great boss who was more of a friend.  I have no reason to feel sorry for myself..  Please, get a pizza for halohoppe.  Maybe it will motivate him to pass it forward and actually earn that pizza slice next to his username before bashing others**
