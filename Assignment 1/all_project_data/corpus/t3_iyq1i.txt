So I just found out that I won't be paid at all this month because of some bookkeeper issues. I work in a small neighborhood cooperative and don't make that much to begin with, but this kinda puts me in a dangerous spot with summer electric bills and increasing rent. I know they can't turn off electricity in the summer, so I might go without paying for a few months. A friend turned me on to this subreddit, so I thought I would see if anyone could help out a redditor in New Orleans. I promise to pay it forward as soon as I can :)
