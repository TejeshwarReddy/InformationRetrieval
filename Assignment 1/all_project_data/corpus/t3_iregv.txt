I am requesting a RAOP for this family that I have been working with, who are in need of at least 1 different meal this month!  This is a family with a disabled veteran whose case is in an appeal status and isn't due to receive a decision within the next year.  They are a family of 5 surviving as best they can.  They refuse to ask for extra because they don't won't to seem greedy or feel that they are being a burden.

I would really like to do something kind for this family, being as though I am a disabled veteran myself, I can't personally give them anything because I don't have it to give, but my organization has donated food items to them.  I really WISH someone could find it in their hearts to gift this family some pizza!  

thanks in advance....
