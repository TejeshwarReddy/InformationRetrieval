Last night we cooked carrots and onions with some spices.  It was... ok. There are six of us living together. I am self employed, N is doing a masters degree in Electronic Engineering, J works building renewable energy devices and teaches kids how to do it, K works at a refugee forum, the other K works in a restaurant and J works with children with learning difficulties.  None of us make much money and I don't think anyone has paid their rent today either.
If anyone is kind enough to get us a couple of vegetarian (spicy) pizzas in Nottingham, England, that would be most appreciated.
Thank you in advance. x
