Long story short: six fish sticks and less than half a head of iceberg between the two of us (my brother and I) in the fridge until friday morning. Ends are being met, but food is at the bottom of the list. lil help? I can't say I can offer anything in return, other than mounds of appreciation...well no wait, if you can think of something i can do in return, ill try my best to fulfill. more than willing to pay it forward, but if you can think of something else i can do, let me know. thanks :)
