Hey guys I'm   college student who lives in a small apartment with my friend and twin brother. We take turns cooking/buying dinner for each other and it's my turn tonight. I've been sick all weekend and would normally just order a pizza, but I instead had to spend my cash on prescriptions and my doctor's visit. If anyone could help out it'd be great. I can prove the doctor's visit and meds via PDF. I live in Tempe Arizona and it would mean the world to me if I could not break this tradition that we have in our apartment.
