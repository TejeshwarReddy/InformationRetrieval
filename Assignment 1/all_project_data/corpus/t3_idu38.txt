To say the least I have had a very long bad day. My Dad was sent to the ER today, and being the oldest kid I'm the one who is in charge of keeping the family together and calm. I'd like to help calm everyone down with some comfort food (like a pizza), but can't afford to do so. 

I know there are plenty of people who need a pizza on here way more than I do, so please help those in need first. I'd just like to give my mom a break and surprise her and my family with some pizza from a stranger. It would def lift our spirits.
