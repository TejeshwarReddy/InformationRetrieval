Have pizza'd one person before, and it felt good, and I've had a good week personally, but a few choice encounters with some individuals this week has left me less than joyful about being part of the human race. Along with the fact that my current financial stability is about to plummet due to some big purchases that I'm just glad I was prepared for, a pretty pie would be the best. I have little to offer in return except for making balloon animals, but I'm awesome at making them! :D If you are in the area maybe we could even hit up a pizza shop together and I'll bring all my circus fun stuff. :)
