For the past two months, I have been trying to get a job (but with still no luck) so I could get the money to pay my college just over $500 by the end of June so I can continue going to school. Luckily, my parents were kind enough to help me pay that by taking on twice as many hours at work. However, with the deadline for the college payment being in the next few days, the house has very little food for the rest of week. 

I feel bad that my parents are working so hard and giving up so much because of me, and I would like to pay them back and give them a decent meal for the night (and leftover-lunch).

If anyone is willing enough to give a $12 eGift Card for Dominos to help, I am totally capable of using online coupons like a boss to be able to feed my whole family very well.

TL;DR my family has very little food now and we would greatly appreciate a $12 eGift Card for Dominos to feed the whole family.
