Hi all! The past few days I've been getting pretty creative putting meals together but it's getting tough. And my older girl's having a hard time adjusting to 1st grade so it'd be a nice surprise for her tonight. If anyone could help that'd be awesome and I'll pay it forward right after I restock the fridge! Thanks!
