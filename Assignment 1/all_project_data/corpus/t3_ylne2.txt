I'm not going to lie. We do have food. We have rice, beans and eggs. That's all we've had for about two weeks now. It is all we will have until the first of the month. Even then, majority of our money (about 1200 between the two to last all of September) will go to rent, bills, gas and the cheapest food we can find. So, while I'm not in complete desperate need of food, my roommate and I are just sick of rice and beans. I would kill to eat something that actually tastes awesome. Thanks.
