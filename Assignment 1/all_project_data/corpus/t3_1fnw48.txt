I live in Baltimore, Maryland very close to a Papa Johns Pizza place. I've been unemployed for over 2 years, struggling to make ends meet. I am loaded with $10,000+ medical bills which I cannot pay because I don't have a job (been struggling trying to find a job, the job environment is pretty crappy here in Baltimore) and many have already been submitted to collections. I've fallen on pretty hard times and I'm hoping there's at least one Redditor on here who is generous enough to give me a Papa Johns eGift Card from here: http://www.papajohns.com/papacard/ so I can have something to eat for today.
