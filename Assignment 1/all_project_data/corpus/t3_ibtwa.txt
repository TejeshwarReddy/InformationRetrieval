Now, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Ramen. It's gotten me through some tough times, and it's getting me through them right now. My girlfriend gets off work in 15 minutes and then faces a 3 hour bus ride home from her call center (she has the most inconveniently scheduled layovers on her route...she has to sit at the transit station for an hour either way she does it). I just moved to the area to be with her because I love her, and haven't been able to find a job to help support us yet, which is unfortunate because her roommate just bailed on her. I did manage to secure a 200/mo food stamp benefit, which renews on the first of the month. But we couldn't manage to make it stretch the whole month our first time around, and we've been living off Ramen since the weekend. I'm sure we'll be able to properly ration ourselves next month, if we're more careful. And I have no problem living on ramen. I just want to do something nice for her since I feel like I'm sitting on my ass all day not contributing anything, looking for jobs on craigslist while she's away at work/stuck on the bus. She's been really upset about the money situation lately, and I just want her to be happy. Unfortunately, she is not as pleased with the Ramen diet as I am. I would give anything to be able to give her something better than this to come home to.

Sorry for that wall of text/sob story. I don't expect anything but I'm not doing anything right now but sitting on my ass waiting for her to get here, so posting this can't hurt.
