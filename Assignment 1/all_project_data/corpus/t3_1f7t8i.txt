My best friend and I share a one room apartment and for the last two months have only been able to afford ramen, if we're lucky. Neither of us get help from our families and we finally both may have gotten  jobs! (i'm going to my interview in about an hour) We would be eternally grateful and would love to celebrate with some pizza!
