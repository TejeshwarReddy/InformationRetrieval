I am a single mother of three who is attending school full time and working part time.  I just applied for food stamps and it will be about three weeks before it comes in.  I do not have a car so I have no way to get to the food pantry that my kids school suggested. I don't get paid until next friday and am really really craving pizza.  (I don't have all the ingredients to make my own)
