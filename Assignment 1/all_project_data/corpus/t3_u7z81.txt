I'm 21, live in North Carolina, and currently my checking account has $16.61 in it.

I'm a college student at UNC, and I quit my job in February to try and start a business (I'm a business major). Things are moving much slower than I expected, but nobody said it would be easy. I think I have a chance to make some money this coming week, but until then this is what I'm stuck with.

I've never been in this place before, I've always had some kind of job since I started working in high school, so I've always had some backup cash. Well once school runs out and the loans are dry here I am, pretty fucked. Dad's helping with rent and bills each month, but I'm ashamed as it is to take money from him, I can't possibly ask for more until he offers it, especially since he tells me they've cut his pay at his current position.

My roommate has been out of town too, and she owes me $50 for her half of the electric, but won't be back in town until Tuesday. Meanwhile, I sit here in the apartment working, trying not to leave lest I spend money or gas, with a near empty kitchen. And I've just run out of bud too. . .

I really enjoy just plain cheese pizza, or maybe cheese and bacon or something simple. It's the simple, little things in life anyway.
