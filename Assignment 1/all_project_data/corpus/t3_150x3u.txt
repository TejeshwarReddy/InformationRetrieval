I would love to brighten up my husbands' day with a pizza(his favorite food). He works so hard for us (2 kids under 2 and me, the wife) and we just learned that he lost his job today. I promise to give back as soon as my husband gets another job (Hopefully soon as the staffing agency told him they will email him about another job).
