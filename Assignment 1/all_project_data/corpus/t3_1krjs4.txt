Hey fellow redditors. Trying to not make a sob story but I'm stranded in a hotel room tonight with no way of knowing what's going to happen tomorrow. Could fealy use a dinner tonight as I am stranded and haven't eaten in about 4 days. If someoul could bless my with a pizza tonight id be so grateful. Thanks so much reddit guys and gals!
