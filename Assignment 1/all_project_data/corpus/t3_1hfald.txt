My paycheck for this month is delayed for some unknown reason, and I will probably get my pay in a few days.
 
It would just make my day a lot better with a pizza while I wait on my pay. The last couple of days have been rough.

Edit. Willing to provide proof of empty bank account if needed. 
Post is a day old still haven't recieved my pay so I am pretty hungry :)

Thank your for reading.
