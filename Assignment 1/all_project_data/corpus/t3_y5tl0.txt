Basically what the title says. I had a 3 day drill this past weekend and although I ate on base for free, I still had to put in $15 a day to get there and back. Very inconvenient, and the pay for that won't hit my account for 7-11 days. So now I have enough to make it to my day job, but not enough to eat. Any help would be hugely appreciated.
