I am new at this, but my friends have done this, and helped out many.
I now have a job to start repaying the favors to people in need, cause I do believe in the golden.

Heard the RAOP has kinda become disappointing over the time, with people not repaying the favor, or doing what people request, or even just thanking people.

I am here for help to turn that around if some of you could show me that there are still some kind hearted people out there and supply my bunk mates, and myself with some zas.

We just got the job building car washes, out of town, and don't get paid for the next two weeks.

Ramen noodles are just not cutting it for this work.

Help however you can, we would be grateful for anything!
