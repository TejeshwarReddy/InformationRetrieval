The summer is an incredibly slow season due to residing in a student saturated city (when school is out, so is the population). Bills among other strokes of terrible luck have left me with less than $1 in my pocket and one box of mac n' cheese without any milk to make it. All I want is to be able to eat some dinner tonight. Help a fellow Redditor out?
