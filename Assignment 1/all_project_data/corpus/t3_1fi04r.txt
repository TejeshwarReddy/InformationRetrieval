so i was recently hired at two different places over the last week, started one job at a sandwich shop last Monday and start at this awesome gourmet pizza place called Pagliacci here in Seattle next Wednesday and after three months of unemployment it couldn't come quickly enough. Wells Fargo literally closed my checking account because it was dormant for three months! Im a hardworking guy who will be working 9am to 12am doubles next week, the recent unemployment has just been a crappy setback for me! pretty difficult. I've been going to foodbanks and primarily dumpster diving to survive, I would absolutely love some pizza and could pay it forward in the future, maybe when my discount kicks in at the new job?
