My wonderful buddy LainIwakura came to my rescue, so I'll be eating tonight :3 Thanks to all you anyway!

This'll be as short as possible since typing is a bit painful (I am also a programmer, the irony), I'm 19, former CS student, but the past year my arthritis (rheumatoid, and osteo in the right knee) has gotten bad enough I had to drop out of uni, leave my job, and recently got the power cut in my apartment- currently I'm house-sitting at my parent's who are on vacation, but they've sort of kept an empty fridge since they've left for 3 weeks and I've come to the conclusion rum is not a proper substitute for food.

I'm in Ontario (Windsor to be exact), so this might be a bit of a pain, and I'm not sure I how I can pay you back, save paying it forward when I'm not at rock bottom. Honestly I'm not even sure where to get pizza around here :3

Thanks regardless to you lovely people for this sub even existing!
