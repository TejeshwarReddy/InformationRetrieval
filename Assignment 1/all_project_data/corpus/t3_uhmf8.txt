My friends and I are poor medical students living out of dorms next to the hospital in Portland, Maine.  There's 3 of us here now, the other 3 are working their morning shift - 6:30AM to 5PM.  I think it would be awesome to surprise them with pizza when they come back. What do you think reddit?  Can we get them some pizza?
