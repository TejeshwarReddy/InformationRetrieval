I was working at a job where I was getting 25-40 hours a week when they suddenly knocked my hours down to 5-18. It took me five months to find this job and work is hard to come by around my area. Also, my girlfriend just got diagnosed cervical cancer so she cannot work. What little food I have left in my house is until my food stamps come in the first week of October. I have some paycheck stubs as proof, but I do not feel comfortable showing them around because of my personal information thats on there. Please help us not eat canned stew tonight again.
