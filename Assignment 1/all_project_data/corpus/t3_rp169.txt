My fiancee and I are waiting for our paydays in a few days (woohoo, her first one in a while!) and we're both working tomorrow. As money is kinda short right now, we'd love it if someone would treat us to pizza tonight so we could go to work tomorrow with memories of delicious, delicious noms. And, we'll be more than happy to reciprocate!
