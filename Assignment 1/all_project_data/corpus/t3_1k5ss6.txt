So... long story short, I'm crashing at my mother's because I'm moving back to this area for a new job I start tomorrow. We don't get along all that great, especially when it comes to food things. She had a pack of burger patties and a pack of brats in her freezer, which I thawed, but apparently am not allowed to cook because "it would stink up the house" and offend her quasi-vegetarian "I don't eat mammals" sensibilities. Nor is there any other readily available food in the house, and I'm broke pending employment and will be saving every scrap to get into an apartment ASAP...
