I will be moving out of town soon, and this is one of the last days that I'll be able to hang out with my amazing group of friends here in Tallahassee. We're all broke at the moment, and moving isn't cheap.
A pizza would be a great "last meal" for us.

I will repay someone in need when I can afford it.

Thanks for your time
