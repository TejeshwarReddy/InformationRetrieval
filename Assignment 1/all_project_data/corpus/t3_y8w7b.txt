Hey reddit, im basically feeling like crap right now. I have a history of falling for the wrong girls but this one really hurt. I took my girl  (soon to be ex I guess) to the movies and dropped her off since she said she had to be home early. After dropping her off I realized I had to go back and give her this small gift I had gotten her that I had forgotten about. That's when I found her getting in a car and when I got closer I saw her kissing some guy that wasn't really my friend but I did know him through mutual friends. I dont know what to do, im just gunna drink a bit (not an alcoholic or anything) but I need to relax, I wasnt really in love with her but I was getting there and im just bummed out, I actually spent all my money on the movies I took her to today, and now just starving, depressed, drinking and craving a damn pizza. That would be awesome, not really expecting a pizza but that would be awesome, just had to rant a bit sorry guys.
