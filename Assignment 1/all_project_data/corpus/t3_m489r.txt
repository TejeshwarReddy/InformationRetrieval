so, i just moved to austin, texas to get out of freezing chicago. Got here a week ago with a little money to last me until I got a job. But........ I was riding my bicycle around to try to get to know the city when I crashed it.

As I lay there with a concussion and a dislocated shoulder, this asshole jammed his hand in my pockets to steal my cell phone and wallet. Then, to top it off, I watched this mother fucker ride away on my bike.

Was real shitty. Went to the hospital and got a sling. Hard to find a job with one of those. Just gave my last dollar away a couple nights ago. I'm really hitting rock bottom now. If anyone could get a pizza out to me, it would temporarily help me out. I am staying on a friends couch right now so I have an address.

I could also send a pic of the hospital report just so you know I am not bullshitting you.
