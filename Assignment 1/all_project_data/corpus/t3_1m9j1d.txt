Hey guys today I worked for the first time in over a year and will do again tomorrow (Unfortunately this is only a one off Job and I may not get another for a while). However it feels great to have worked again and I'll be earning some cash in hand money tomorrow :D. Anyways I would love a pizza and would reciprocate as soon as possible (But seeing as I don't have a job and the money for this will go towards paying rent to my family -Recent college (high school) leaver it probably won't be for quite a while) cheers!
TL;DR Worked first day in over a year one off thing would love an happy time pizza.
