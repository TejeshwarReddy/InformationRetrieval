I'm re-posting, as my post of three days ago wasn't replied to.

Following a longgg period of underemployment, I found full-time work at this call centre; pay's great, benefits are great, but they're holding my wages a MONTH (as they do all new hires), and I'm utterly broke.

A hot meal would be so, so nice today.

I've asked and received here once before, 1 - 2 months ago. Hoping to be in the spot to pay this forward soon. Thanks a lot, RAoP!
