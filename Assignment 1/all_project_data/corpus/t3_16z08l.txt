Hey RAoP, I'm a student in Raleigh and unfortunately this month has been hard on my wallet. I spent a large chunk of my money on a gift for my girlfriend's birthday and I spent the whole day driving out to get it. On top of that, my university closed its dining hall early tonight because of the holiday so I'm running off of the small amount of snacks I have in my dorm. I would love for some warm food tonight if anyone is generous enough.
