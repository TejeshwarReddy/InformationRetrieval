UK - I don't want to sound like i'm begging but i live in the uk and there is a few days now before i can go home. I have ran out of food and i am living off bread. After the exams i am just fed up and want to go home. I do not even need a full pizza, a kebab would even be most appreciated right now. Thanks anyone if you can help.

As a side note: i did not know whether to put this worldwide or not. I have never done this before and if i paid for it then i can pay with paypal. If others do then i guess it would be uk only.
