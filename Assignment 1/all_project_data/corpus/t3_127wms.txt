Tomorrow I am moving home and it is a scrape to do but for health reasons I have to move away from this particular home. I have no money to buy food until Thursday (I get paid then).

Hopefully someone will be able to help me out tonight if not then thanks anyway.


Sadly getting to the point where I only have a couple hours left to do anything ( I have to get to bed early ish so I can get up early to move. If I can get anyone to help in the next 2 hours or 3 that would be awesome.


Well thanks anyways guys :). It was a long shot but thanks. Even though I didnt get pizza's it dont matter
