Hi guys, Anderson/Clemson, SC area here. My roommates and I are broke and could use a pizza to eat tonight.  Three of us just got new jobs but we are stretched a little thin from moving into a new place.  Our cash flow is pretty screwed until next week.

I will provide any sort of verification that you could want.  I've been lurking reddit since the digg v4 thing but I just signed up for an account 6 months ago, although I rarely login.

Also, I have a SoftLayer dedicated server that I'd be willing to give you some space on for web hosting / FTP / data backup.
(The server is paid up for several more months so you'd get plenty of value from it!)

If somebody can come through for us, that would be awesome!
