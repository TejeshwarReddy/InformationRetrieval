Hi guys, I missed an entire week of work and I have one dollar left, I had a tooth abscess on me and had to have extremely painful surgery, the infection is all gone finally and I can eat again, been stuck drinking ensure since Thursday, trouble is this poor girl is broker than broke, I have three of us to feed and dunno what i'm going to do for dinner, there is one can of soup in the cupboard. If someone would be willing to front me a pizza when i get paid next i'll gift one to someone. Pweeese?

EDIT :Also I don't have family...so there will be no thanksgiving meal for me this year, this would really be a nice happy thing, I could use it right at the moment :-( And PapaJohns is the chain we have here.

EDIT: This really would mean so much to me guys, I've never had to deal with getting a tooth pulled before and my face is just returning to normal, the last thing I need right now is stress, I have two others that live with me who haven't been able to find a job because of the economy so I'm the only one who works, this is going to put is in a tight spot and I'm still not sure how things are going to go but for tonight, the first night I have the ability to even have solid food, I don't want to worry.  Also if interested I can provide a picture of a very doofy looking dog, possibly two in exchange.
