I just moved to Austin, Texas from a small town in west Texas to look for a job and try to make it in the big city. I'm sleeping on a friends floor and living out of a suitcase. I gave my friend most of the money I had to put towards utilities and bills since he's on disability and is barely scraping by himself. I've applied for food stamps and have an interview on Monday, but some pizza to help me through the weekend would be a godsend. I only have like $12 but I really need to save that for bus fair or toothpaste or something. Anyway, I guess this is a shot in the dark but I'm hungry and desperate so I'll try anything. Once I get on my feet I'll be more than happy to pass the favor on. Thanks for reading =]
