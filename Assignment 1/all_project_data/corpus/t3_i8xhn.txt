Last few days alone in my student house before i'm homeless. Would really appreciate a solid meal to cheer me up and give me the energy to carry on looking for jobs/somewhere to live. I'm sure there are people more worthy than I, but i feel i've exhausted everything else bar soup kitchens. I'm pretty new to all this,, but i'm sure i'll be back on my feet soon and will be happy to repay the favour to another worthy redditor.
