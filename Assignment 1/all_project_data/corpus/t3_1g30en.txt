Hi guys!

Me and my girlfriend came to the US yesterday. It is so cool here! :) We start working on Wednesday and are kinda strapped for money until then. We are anxious to try anything that is American, and pizza is definitely something related to USA.

We're not too picky, we'd like to try something classic. It is not us to decide what is classic to you, so let it be your pick :)

We live in Kill Devil Hills, NC. There are some places which deliver, but we don't really know them anyways, so again it would be your pick :)

Thanks!
