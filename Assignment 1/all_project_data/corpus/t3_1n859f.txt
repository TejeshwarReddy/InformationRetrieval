This week has been hell.  I've been depressed lately.  I've barely enough to pay rent this month.  School's just becoming a bit much right now.  We're almost out of groceries here at the apt, too.  I've not eaten much in the last two days.  It's driving me nuts...

I would be so grateful if someone could help out.
