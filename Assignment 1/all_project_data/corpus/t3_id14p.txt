Well, me and my girlfriend are celebrating our two years and I don't have any money whatsoever to pay for anything for her. I work at burger king but my paycheck goes straight to my savings account, for my little baby girl on the way. I would really appreciate if someone could send me a pizza, I know I'm new on here, but I found this site from wishuponahero. I recieved some clothes from there, but haven't asked for something of this sort. I just need this help just once.
