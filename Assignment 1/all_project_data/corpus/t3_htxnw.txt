Long story short, my mom and I are currently unemployed (ive been unemployed for 2 months now) and have no food in our house. We just spent the last of our money to pay our electricity bill (after they shut it off) and get dog food. We currently have no gas at our house so its been nothing but cold showers and microwaveable ramen cups for the last month, so a nice warm pizza would sure improve our day. I promise to not only pay the back the person who treats us, but would also repay the favor to another person needing a pizza in the future (after i can get employed) thanks

i forgot to add, we are in naperville (chicago area), IL

thank you sunbear0326 for the pizza! its a great change of pace! &lt;3
