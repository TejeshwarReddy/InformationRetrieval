I've been on reddit for awhile and have been mostly a lurker. I saw random acts of pizza and figured I'd give it a try. I'm a firm believer in paying it forward and would do so if this goes through. However, if I get dejected I will still offer a free pizza to others in the future. =) 

I'm moving on September 13th and this is one of the last times I get to hang with my friends before I have to go. No sob story here, just thought I'd give it a try. ^^
