My mother and little sisters land lord left a note on their door stating that if they don't pay their current and late rent amount in 2 days that they will be evicted. The landlord is always really lenient with my mother so it's understandable and pretty predictable that this would eventually happen due to how far my mother got behind. I immediately went to the bank, withdrew every dime I had, got a money order and took it to their land lord. 

I did this fully aware that I'd be without and with no regrets. My mother and sister having a roof over their head is far more important then me going a couple days without food. I have a well paying job and I'm rarely home which explains why I have no food in my refrigerator. I help people out whenever I get the chance. However, My belly is really screaming "fuck you" at the moment.. So it would be pretty rad if someone could loan me the money for a pizza. I get paid Monday, and I'm a lady of my word so you can best believe this will be paid back or paid forward. 

The throwaway account is because I don't ask for help, I just don't. It's embarrassing and a touchy situation so I'd rather hide behind a bitch account. Growing up we were always needing help with something, and I really don't like asking for help.. However if someone is willing to help I WILL give you my account name, I can even give you my mothers number so you can verify this.
