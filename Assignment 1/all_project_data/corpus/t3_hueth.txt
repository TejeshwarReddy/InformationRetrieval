I'm living with my sister, and have been looking for a job. I've been giving guitar lessons so I can pay for whatever food I can buy on my own.

My sister and them barely get by, and there are some days when the kids have nothing to eat.

I've been buying ramen and large packages of mushroom soup and crackers. Mushroom soup has gone from my favourite food, to making me sick.

I live in Canada. Winnipeg, MB.

Got a lovely chicken, onion pizza, and a pepperoni and sausage pizza, with some cheese bread courtesy of **birdnoir**

Best meal I've had in awhile.
