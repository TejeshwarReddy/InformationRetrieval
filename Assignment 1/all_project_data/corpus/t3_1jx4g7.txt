I am sure there are a ton of starving college students out there, but I am practically at my lowest right now. After the rent and bills, I have $10 dollars in my bank account. I work at an organic chemistry stockroom, and the higher ups are constantly finding a way to lower the amount of hours I can write on my time sheet. I work more than 40 hours a week, and I can only put in 20 hours. So all my financial plans from the beginning of the Summer went down the drain... I am hungry, and I would love some comfort food.

So that's my story. It would be nice to hear from anyone right now. Thanks for listening.
