The NHL is back! When I get out of work tomorrow I'm looking forward to relaxing and watch as much hockey as I can. A pizza from the Pizza Hut right by my house would be an added plus. I've given before on another account. http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/iouna/request_im_broke_sick_recently_single_and_hungry/
Go Wings and Broncos!
Edit: just realized it's my cake day. So much karma wasted.
