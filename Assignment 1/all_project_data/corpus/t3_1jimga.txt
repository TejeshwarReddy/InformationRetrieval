I may have gotten my subreddits mixed up, is there a difference between this one and /r/randomactsofpizza?  Oh well, might as well try both...

So a little over 3 weeks ago I lost my job, and I THOUGHT I had another job lined up, but unfortunately that fell through. I've been barely making a meal a day out of bare bones food (ramen, rice, beans) and have no money to buy anything else at the moment. The job hunt is not going as smoothly as I had hoped, and apparently I have to wait until NEXT week for unemployment to give me anything, which will go mostly to my rent. 

With every day I don't get a new job my situation seems bleaker and bleaker. And the fact that I've been barely surviving on a meager portion of tasteless crap every day is not helping my outlook on life. I don't think I could write the words that would properly convey what a nice, crispy, cheesy pizza would do to boost my spirits, and I don't want to get my hopes too far up by typing it out.  All I'm gonna say is, if any kind soul out there would send some pizza my way (I'm in NYC, btw) it would mean the world to me.
