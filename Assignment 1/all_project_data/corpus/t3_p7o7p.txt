Hi Reddit.

I hate asking for charity. But it's been a rough couple of weeks. I have no money for the next couple of days, no way of earning more that quickly, and not much food bar some baked beans in the fridge.

On top of that, I'm ill. Not Beastie Boys ill, 'all my joints hurt and my hands won't stop shaking, I hate flu' ill. I should emphasise that I'm not starving, though. It's not 'please send me pizza, I have nothing to eat', it's 'please send me pizza, I don't want to have to eat the same terrible cheap food for the next couple of days'.

And it is written, man cannot live on beans alone, so I was hoping one of you might be generous enough to help me out. The full sob story's available on request if you're interested, plus pictures or whatever verification. Thanks for reading.
