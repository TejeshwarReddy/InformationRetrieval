No sob story here. Just a little tight on cash until next Friday, and do not want to eat Ramen everyday until then. I make decent money for my age, but have to pay off college loans and other living expenses. I took some time off to do family stuff for the 4th of July and just didn't pull in the kind of money I'm used to these past pay checks. I'll be back to normal next Friday, but was just hoping I could have the indulgence of having a pizza before then. Hopefully I can repay the favor to another fellow redditor in need of some delicious cheesy goodness once I get my next pay check :)

(Northwest Florida Panhandle) if that needs to be clarified.
