The title basically sums it up. I'm not looking for pity, just a helping hand. I'm a college student and I work part time at a decent job, but things are rough right now.

   I've been paying my own bills since I was 17 or so, and have garnered a great deal of respect for the life of the working adult over the past couple of years. You never really appreciate the basics until you realize how much they actually cost. I'm currently putting myself through college while paying every bill that comes my way, so as expected, things are naturally tight. But a couple days ago my car broke down and after paying my internet bill (which was a necessity, since I work from home) I don't even have $1.00 to my name.

I'm not going to be broke forever, but my girlfriend and I are getting really burned out eating rice and ramen. A pizza would be much appreciated and would also be great surprise for my lady when she gets home in the morning (she's been 12 hour night shifts non-stop to help pay our bills, and finance a vacation that we have planned next month)

edit: I'm located in Nevada, USA. Near Las Vegas. 

Thanks RAoP, and I'll definitely return the favor when possible :)
