After a 3 months of joblessness I have finally found a steady position at IdeoMed. The company makes iOS apps that remind kids to take their asthma medication on time and alerts doctors when an asthma attack is recorded.

Sadly I am still broke until January rolls through:

A pizza would be awesome and I would love to return the favor on my first paycheck.

I'd be happy to help anyone on /r/csshelp too :)
