***EDITED***

Edit: My friend offered to buy me pizza. Hopefully another time, RAoP'ers!

~~I'm a student at the University of Northern Iowa and I'm working on a web application that I think will be massively useful and hopefully nicely profitable for me Some Day(tm). But until it makes me money, I'm basically broke.~~

Looking forward to the day I can give back a random act of pizza,

Aaron
