On sunday, my boss called me saying that he just received a letter from the city stating that he does not have the right building permits to do deliveries (public bathroom, tables, etc). So I got laid off. He offered my job but it was during the times when I'm in school so I couldn't take it.

Afterwards I was glad I had another 2 other jobs to fall back on at school. The next day I went and talked to both teachers about the jobs, both hired me for another semester. The I go to the work study off and it turns out that wasn't the case. I had lost my work study job due to my school's budget being cut. 

At least school was paid off with some money leftover for me to live off of along with the money I saved up from working. I know it will be hard for me to find a job since I am in school full time. Some free pizza would at least put a smile on my face (and some of my unemployed friends' faces as well) after this, along with saving me some money.

If it helps, I have done the past 3 gift exchanges all with at least one rematch. Feel free to check that out. Maybe that will help my Karma for this one. http://redditgifts.com/profiles/view/Kaidenshiba/
