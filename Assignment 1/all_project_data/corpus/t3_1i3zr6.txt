We moved to Austin recently, and our spare food money was in a PayPal account. We overlooked that our PayPal debit card expired back in April. We've contacted PayPal already, and the debit card is in the mail, and should be arriving tomorrow. All we have until then is several packs of Ramen noodles. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: I have someone calling in an order for me, for which I am grateful.

Edit2: I have the pizza on the way. Thanks go to gratefulstringcheese!
