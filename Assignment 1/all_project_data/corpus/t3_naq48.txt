My last final is tomorrow, but due to Drum Corps stuff, I'll probably be living here away from home until next Monday. I'm out of university money and real money, spent the last of it on bills and a meal the other day. 

I understand if this isn't going to happen, just hoping that some person out there will want to donate a bit of love to a Redditor and his friend. 

If anyone can do this, I  live in Greensboro, NC
