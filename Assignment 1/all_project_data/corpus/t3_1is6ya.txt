We're riding on RAGBRAI (ragbrai.com, if you're curious (on mobile! Hard to format!)). 

We're sitting around talking about how cool it'd be to have some pizza. 1 pizza. 2 pizzas. 100 pizzas. Any pizza would be cool. 

We'll be camping in Perry, IA tomorrow and Des Moines, IA the day after that. 

We'll prove it. Internet is limited, but we can call/text easily. 

We'll take cool pictures of us eating this hypothetical pizza to help show our gratitude.
