It is me and my girlfriend's anniversary today, later tonight actually, and I kinda want to do something nice for her like a pizza dinner. Problem is, I am unemployed at the moment, so I can't really afford much besides rent. I've been tryin like crazy to get one or two of those avoid the noid cards, but no luck and today is the last day.  Could anyone help me out? Either with a pizza or a gift card? Or just well wishes.
