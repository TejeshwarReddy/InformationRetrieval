I'll be honest, I'm not going to starve without it. However, I'm trying to power through and get a bunch of A.P. homework done and could really go for some pizza.

Location: Southern Oregon.  

Papa John's is the only one that will deliver.  I don't have enough gas to go pick one up.

EDIT: No longer needed.
