The roads were exceptionally frozen this morning after a horrible rain last night. My car slid into someone elses, and caused a lot of damage. I have no collision insurance, thus I will have to pay out of pocket and alas, do not have the means to do so.

My car is now at a shop getting an estimate done, and I am at home with no food and no means to go out and get something hot to eat. Anyone willing to help me out with a pizza? I can surely either pay it back or pay it forward once I am more aware of my financial situation.
